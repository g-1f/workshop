In particular, information appearing under \"Business,\" \"Risk Factors,\" and \"Management\\'s\\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition\" includes forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include all\\nstatements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and generally can be identified by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\"\\n\"expect,\" \"project,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"plan,\" \"continue,\" or similar expressions or future or conditional verbs.\\nForward-looking statements inherently involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in\\nforward-looking statements. Where, in any forward-looking statement, we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events, it is based on\\nmanagement\\'s current plans and expectations, expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, we can give no assurance\\nthat any such expectation or belief will result or will be achieved or accomplished. Investors therefore should not place undue reliance on forward-looking\\nstatements. The following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated:\\n•\\nthe significant costs and uncertainties in the pharmaceutical research and development process, including with respect to the timing and process of\\nobtaining regulatory approvals;\\n•\\nthe impact and outcome of acquisitions and business development transactions and related integration costs;\\n•\\nthe expiration of intellectual property protection for certain of our products and competition from generic and/or biosimilar products;\\n•\\nour ability to protect and enforce patents and other intellectual property;\\n•\\nchanges in patent law or regulations related to data package exclusivity;\\n•\\ncompetitive developments affecting current products and our pipeline;\\n•\\nmarket uptake of recently launched products;\\n•\\ninformation technology system inadequacies, breaches, or operating failures;\\n•\\nunauthorized access, disclosure, misappropriation, or compromise of confidential information or other data stored in our information technology\\nsystems, networks, and facilities, or those of third parties with whom we share our data;\\n•\\nthe impact of global macroeconomic conditions, trade disruptions, disputes, unrest, war, regional dependencies, or other costs, uncertainties and\\nrisks related to engaging in business globally;\\n•\\nunexpected safety or efficacy concerns associated with our products;\\n•\\nlitigation, investigations, or other similar proceedings involving past, current, or future products or commercial activities as we are largely self-insured;\\n•\\nissues with product supply and regulatory approvals stemming from manufacturing difficulties, disruptions, or shortages, including as a result of\\nunpredictability and variability in demand, labor shortages, third-party performance, quality, or regulatory actions related to our facilities;\\n•\\ndependence on certain products for a significant percentage of our total revenue and an increasingly consolidated supply chain;\\n•\\nreliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements;\\n•\\nthe impact of public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\\n•\\nregulatory changes or other developments;\\n•\\nregulatory actions regarding operations and products;\\n•\\ncontinued pricing pressures and the impact of actions of governmental and private payers affecting pricing of, reimbursement for, and access to\\npharmaceuticals;\\n•\\ndevaluations in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates and inflation;\\n•\\nchanges in tax law, tax rates, or events that differ from our assumptions related to tax positions;\\n•\\nasset impairments and restructuring charges;\\n3\\n', '•\\nchanges in accounting and reporting standards promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Securities and Exchange\\nCommission (SEC);\\n•\\nregulatory compliance problems or government investigations; and\\n•\\nactual or perceived deviation from environmental-, social-, or governance-related requirements or expectations.\\nInvestors should also carefully read the factors described under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain\\nrisks that could, among other things, cause our actual results to differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. Investors should understand\\nthat it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the risks described above and under Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" to be a\\ncomplete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.\\nAll forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Annual Report and are expressly qualified in their entirety by the risk factors and\\ncautionary statements included in this Annual Report.

We adapt our marketing methods and product emphasis in various countries to meet local customer needs and\\ncomply with local regulations.\\nU.S.\\nWe promote our major products in the U.S. through sales representatives who engage with physicians and other healthcare professionals. We also\\neducate healthcare providers about our products in various other ways, including promoting in online channels, distributing literature and samples of\\ncertain products to physicians, and exhibiting at medical meetings. In addition, we advertise certain products directly to consumers in the U.S., and we\\nmaintain websites and other media channels with information about our major products. We supplement our employee sales force with contract sales\\norganizations to leverage our resources and reach additional patients in need.\\nWe maintain special business groups to service wholesalers, pharmacy benefit managers, managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations,\\ngovernment and long-term care institutions, hospitals, and certain retail pharmacies. We enter into arrangements with these organizations providing for\\ndiscounts or rebates on our products.\\nIn the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals.\\nIn 2022, 2021, and 2020, three wholesale distributors in the U.S.—McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc.—\\neach accounted for a significant percentage of our consolidated revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10 percent of our consolidated\\nrevenue in any of these years. For additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2: Revenue.\"\\nOutside the U.S.\\nThe products we market and distribution of our products vary from country to country. Outside the U.S., we promote our products to healthcare providers\\nthrough sales representatives and other channels. In most countries in which we operate, we maintain our own sales organizations, but in some countries\\nwe market our products through third parties, some of which we have engaged through distribution and promotion arrangements.\\nMarketing Collaborations\\nCertain of our products are marketed in arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. For example, we and Boehringer Ingelheim have a global\\nagreement to develop and commercialize a portfolio of diabetes products, including Trajenta , Jentadueto , Jardiance, Glyxambi , Synjardy , Trijardy\\nXR, and Basaglar.\\nFor additional information, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"\\nCompetition\\nOur products compete globally with many other pharmaceutical products in highly competitive markets.\\nImportant competitive factors include effectiveness, safety, and ease of use; formulary placement, price, payer coverage and reimbursement rates, and\\ndemonstrated cost-effectiveness; regulatory approvals; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products, processes, modalities,\\nand uses. Most new products or uses that we introduce must compete with other branded, biosimilar, or generic products already on the market or that\\nare later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products, uses, or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, including\\nby developing new modalities, our products become subject to decreased sales volumes, progressive price reductions, or both.\\nWe believe our long-term competitive success depends on discovering and developing (either alone or in collaboration with others) or acquiring\\ninnovative, cost-effective products that provide improved outcomes for patients and deliver value to payers, and continuously improving the productivity of\\nour operations in a highly competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in commercially successful products, and it is\\npossible that our products will be, or will become, uncompetitive from time to time as a result of products or uses developed by our competitors.\\n®\\n®\\n®\\n®\\n®\\n7\\n', 'Generic Pharmaceuticals\\nOne of the biggest competitive challenges we face is from generic pharmaceuticals. In the U.S., Europe, Japan, and other jurisdictions, the regulatory\\napproval process for pharmaceuticals (other than biological products (biologics)) exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to\\ndemonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product. As a result, generic\\nmanufacturers generally invest far fewer resources than we do for our branded products in research and development and can price their products\\nsignificantly lower than our branded products. Accordingly, when a branded non-biologic pharmaceutical loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces\\nintense price competition from generic forms of the product, which can result in the loss of a significant portion of the product\\'s revenue in a very short\\nperiod of time. Moreover, governments in some countries leverage generic entrants to drive price concessions through the utilization of volume-based\\nprocurement bidding and other measures.\\nFurther, public and private payers typically encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs. Laws in the\\nU.S. generally allow, and in many cases require, pharmacists to substitute generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be\\nessentially equivalent to a brand-name drug. Where substitution is mandatory, it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it. In\\ncertain countries outside the U.S., intellectual property protection is weak, and we must compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products\\nrelatively shortly after launch.\\nBiosimilars\\nA number of our products and potential new medicines in our clinical-stage pipeline are biologics. In the U.S., the FDA regulates biologics under the\\nFederal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and implementing regulations. Competition for Lilly\\'s biologics may be affected by\\nthe approval of follow-on biologics, also known as biosimilars. A biosimilar is a subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that, due to its\\nanalytical and clinical similarity to the innovator biologic, may be approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing\\nrequired of the innovator biologic. Approval by the FDA ultimately depends on many factors, including a showing that the biosimilar is \"highly similar\" to\\nthe original product and has no clinically meaningful differences from the original product in terms of safety, purity, and potency.\\nGlobally, most governments have developed abbreviated regulatory pathways to approve biosimilars as follow-ons to innovator-developed biologics,\\nincluding the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCIA) in the U.S. A number of biosimilars have been licensed under the\\nBPCIA, as well as in Europe and Japan. The patent and regulatory exclusivity for the existing innovator biologic generally must expire in a given market\\nbefore biosimilars may enter that market. In addition, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for the innovator biologic in a\\nway that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biologic products is not yet entirely clear, and will depend on a number of regulatory and\\nmarketplace factors that are still developing. In the U.S., currently only a biosimilar product that is determined to be \"interchangeable\" by the FDA will be\\nconsidered substitutable for the original biologic product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the original biologic product.\\nThe FDA requirements for interchangeability are evolving but the FDA has issued several \"interchangeable\" designations for biosimilar products,\\nincluding for competitive insulin products, and is expected to continue doing so in the future.\\nRegulatory interpretation of important aspects of the laws regulating biosimilars continues to evolve and, therefore, the impact of these laws on our\\nbusiness remains subject to substantial uncertainty. Biosimilars may present both competitive challenges and opportunities. While competitors have\\ndeveloped biosimilars that compete with our products, we have developed, and may continue to develop, our own biosimilars.\\nU.S. Private Sector Dynamics\\nIn the U.S. private sector, consolidation and integration among healthcare organizations significantly affects the competitive marketplace for\\npharmaceuticals. Health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers, and other supply chain stakeholders have been\\nconsolidating into fewer, larger entities, thus enhancing their market power and importance. Private third-party insurers, as well as governments, typically\\nmaintain formularies that specify coverage (the conditions under which drugs are included on a plan\\'s formulary) and reimbursement (the associated out-\\nof-pocket cost to the consumer) to control costs by negotiating discounts or rebates in exchange for formulary inclusion and placement.\\n8\\n', 'Formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of a drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restrictions, such as prior authorizations\\nand formulary exclusions, or due to reimbursement limitations that result in higher consumer out-of-pocket cost, such as non-preferred co-pay tiers,\\nincreased co-insurance levels, and higher deductibles. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies face increased pressure in negotiations, and compete\\nfiercely for formulary placement, not only on the basis of product attributes such as efficacy, safety profile, or patient ease of use, but also by providing\\nrebates or other concessions. As payers and pharmaceutical companies continue to negotiate formulary placement and rebates, value-based\\nagreements, where rebates may be based on achievement (or not) of specified outcomes, are another tool that has become increasingly prevalent. Cost\\nis an increasingly important factor in formulary decisions, particularly in treatment areas in which the payer has taken the position that multiple branded\\nproducts are therapeutically comparable. These pressures have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our consolidated results of\\noperations. In addition to formulary placement, changes in insurance designs continue to drive greater consumer cost-sharing through high deductible\\nplans and higher co-insurance or co-pays. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see \"—Regulations\\nand Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access—U.S.\"\\nPatents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights\\nOverview\\nIntellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life sciences innovations and invest in the search for new\\nmedicines and uses. We own, have applied for, or are licensed under, a large number of patents in the U.S. and many other countries relating to products,\\nproduct uses, formulations, and manufacturing processes. In addition, as discussed below, for some products we have effective intellectual property\\nprotection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory laws.\\nThe patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to pharmaceuticals is provided by national patents claiming the active ingredient (the compound\\npatent) for our products, particularly those in major markets such as the U.S., major European countries, and Japan. These patents may be issued based\\nupon the filing of international patent applications, usually filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applications covering compounds are\\ngenerally filed during the discovery phase of the drug discovery process, which is described in the \"Research and Development\" section below. In\\ngeneral, national patents in each relevant country are available for a period of 20 years from the filing date of the PCT application, which is often years\\nprior to the launch of a commercial product. Further patent term adjustments and restorations may extend the original patent term:\\n•\\nPatent term adjustment is a statutory right available to all U.S. patent applicants to provide relief in the event that a patent grant is delayed during\\nexamination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).\\n•\\nPatent term restoration is a statutory right provided to U.S. patent holders that claim inventions subject to review by the FDA. To compensate for\\na portion of the time invested in clinical trials and the FDA review process, a single patent for a pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent\\nterm restoration. Patent term restoration is determined by a formula that cannot be calculated until product approval due to the uncertainty of the\\nduration of clinical trials and the time it takes the FDA to review an application. There is a five-year cap on any restoration, and no patent\\'s\\nexpiration date may be extended beyond 14 years from FDA approval. Some countries outside the U.S. similarly offer forms of patent term\\nrestoration for patents claiming inventions subject to a local review by a regulatory agency. For example, Supplementary Protection Certificates\\nare available to extend the life of a European patent up to an additional five years (subject to a 15-year cap from European Medicines Agency\\n(EMA) approval). Also, in Japan, South Korea, Australia, and other jurisdictions, patent terms can be extended up to five years, depending on the\\nlength of regulatory review and other factors.\\n9\\n', 'Loss of effective patent protection for pharmaceuticals, especially for non-biologic products, typically results in the loss of effective market exclusivity for\\nthe product, often leading to a severe and rapid decline in revenues for the product. However, in some cases the innovator company may retain\\nexclusivity despite approval of the generic, biosimilar, or other follow-on versions of a new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent\\nthrough manufacturing trade secrets, later-expiring patents on manufacturing processes, methods of use or formulations, or data protection that may be\\navailable under pharmaceutical regulatory laws. Changes to the laws and regulations governing these protections could result in earlier loss of effective\\nmarket exclusivity. The primary forms of data protection are as follows:\\n•\\nRegulatory authorities in major markets generally grant data package protection for a period of years following new drug approvals in recognition\\nof the substantial investment required to complete clinical trials. Data package protection prohibits other manufacturers from submitting\\nregulatory applications for marketing approval in reliance on the innovator company\\'s regulatory submission data for the drug. The base period of\\ndata package protection depends on the country. For example, the period is generally five years in the U.S. (12 years for new biologics as\\ndescribed below), effectively 10 years in Europe, and eight years in Japan. The period begins on the date of product approval and runs\\nconcurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent.\\n•\\nUnder the BPCIA, the FDA has the authority to approve biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to show\\nits molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include a certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the FDA will consider\\non a case-by-case basis. Under the data protection provisions of this law, the FDA cannot approve a biosimilar application until 12 years after\\ninitial marketing approval of the innovator biologic, subject to certain conditions.\\n•\\nIn the U.S., the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in\\npediatric or adolescent populations within a specified time period. If granted, this \"pediatric exclusivity\" provides an additional six months of\\nexclusivity, which is added to the term of data protection and, for products other than biologics, to the term of any relevant patents, to the extent\\nthese protections have not already expired. While the term of the pediatric exclusivity begins upon the expiration of the relevant patent, pediatric\\nexclusivity is a regulatory exclusivity—i.e., a bar to generic or biosimilar approval, not a patent right.\\n•\\nUnder the U.S. orphan drug law, a specific use of a drug or biologic can receive \"orphan\" designation if it is intended to treat a disease or\\ncondition affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S., or affecting more than 200,000 people but not reasonably expected to recover its\\ndevelopment and marketing costs through U.S. sales. Among other benefits, orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven\\nyears of market exclusivity, meaning that the FDA cannot (with limited exceptions) approve another marketing application for the same drug for\\nthe same indication until expiration of the seven-year period. Unlike pediatric exclusivity, the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and runs\\nin parallel with any applicable patents.\\nOutside the major markets, the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for pharmaceuticals varies widely, and in a number of these\\nmarkets we are unable to patent our products or to enforce the patents that we receive for our products. Under the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual\\nProperty (TRIPs) Agreement administered by the World Trade Organization, more than 140 countries have agreed to provide non-discriminatory\\nprotection for most pharmaceutical inventions and to assure that adequate and effective rights are available to patent owners. Certain developing\\ncountries limit protection for biopharmaceutical products under their interpretation of \"flexibilities\" allowed under the TRIPs Agreement. Thus, some types\\nof patents, such as those on new uses of compounds or new forms of molecules, are not available in certain developing countries. Further, many\\ndeveloping countries, and some developed countries, do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in the TRIPs\\nAgreement.\\nOur Intellectual Property Portfolio\\nWe consider intellectual property protection for certain products, processes, uses, and formulations—particularly with respect to those products discussed\\nbelow—to be important to our operations. In addition to the patents and data protection identified below, we may hold patents on manufacturing\\nprocesses, formulations, devices, or uses that extend exclusivity beyond the dates shown below. For approved products, dates include, where applicable,\\npending or granted patent term extensions.\\n10\\n', \"The most relevant U.S. patent protection or data protection and associated expiry dates for our major or recently launched patent-protected marketed\\nproducts are as follows:\\n•\\nCyramza is protected by a compound patent and biologics data protection (2026).\\n•\\nEmgality is protected by a compound patent (2033) and biologics data protection (2030).\\n•\\nJardiance, and the related combination product Glyxambi, is protected by a compound patent (2028).\\n•\\nJaypirca is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2028).\\n•\\nMounjaro is protected by a compound patent (2036) and by data protection (2027).\\n•\\nOlumiant is protected by a compound patent (2032).\\n•\\nRetevmo is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2025).\\n•\\nReyvow  is protected by a compound patent (2030).\\n•\\nTaltz is protected by a compound patent (2030) and by biologics data protection (2028).\\n•\\nTrulicity is protected by a compound patent (2027) and by biologics data protection (2027).\\n•\\nVerzenio is protected by a compound patent (2031).\\nOutside the U.S., important patent protection or data protection includes:\\n•\\nBaqsimi  is protected by data protection in Japan (2026).\\n•\\nCyramza is protected by a compound patent (2028) and by data protection (2024) in major European countries, and by a compound patent\\n(2026) and by data protection (2023) in Japan.\\n•\\nEmgality is protected by a compound patent (2033) and by data protection (2028) in major European countries, and by a compound patent\\n(2035) and by data protection (2029) in Japan.\\n•\\nJardiance is protected by a compound patent in major European countries (2029) and Japan (2030).\\n•\\nMounjaro is protected by a compound patent in major European countries (2037) and Japan (2040).\\n•\\nOlumiant is protected by a compound patent (2032) and by data protection (2027) in major European countries, and by a compound patent\\n(2033) and by data protection (2025) in Japan.\\n•\\nRetevmo is protected by a compound patent (2037) and by data protection (2031) in major European countries, and by a compound patent\\n(2038) and by data protection (2029) in Japan.\\n•\\nReyvow is protected by data protection (2032) in major European countries, and a compound patent ( 2028) and by data protection (2032) in\\nJapan.\\n•\\nTaltz is protected by a compound patent (2031) and data protection (2027) in major European countries and a compound patent (2030) and data\\nprotection (2024) in Japan.\\n•\\nTrulicity is protected by a compound patent (2029) and by data protection (2024) in major European countries and by a compound patent (2029)\\nand by data protection (2023) in Japan.\\n•\\nVerzenio is protected by a compound patent (2033) and data protection (2028) in major European countries and by a compound patent (2034)\\nand data protection (2026) in Japan.\\nThe following product candidates are the most relevant currently under regulatory review.

Trademark protection varies throughout the\\nworld, with protection continuing in some countries as long as the mark is used, and in other countries as long as it is registered. Registrations are\\nnormally for fixed but renewable terms. Trademark protection typically extends beyond the patent and data protection for a product.\\nPatent Licenses and Collaborations\\nMost of our major products are not subject to significant license and collaboration agreements. For information on our license and collaboration\\nagreements, see Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4: Collaborations and Other Arrangements.\"\\nPatent Challenges\\nIn the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, authorizes the FDA to\\napprove generic versions of innovative pharmaceuticals (other than biologics, which are discussed below in more detail) when the generic manufacturer\\nhas not conducted safety and efficacy studies but files an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). In an ANDA, the generic manufacturer must\\ndemonstrate only \"pharmaceutical equivalence\" and \"bioequivalence\" between the generic version and the New Drug Application (NDA)-approved-drug,\\nnot safety and efficacy. Establishing pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic\\ncompany.\\nAbsent a patent challenge, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA until after certain of the innovator\\'s patents expire. However, after the innovator has\\nmarketed its product for four years, a generic manufacturer may file an ANDA alleging that one or more of the patents listed in the innovator\\'s NDA are\\ninvalid or not infringed. This allegation is commonly known as a \"Paragraph IV certification.\" If the innovator responds by filing suit against the generic\\nmanufacturer, the FDA is then prohibited from approving the generic company\\'s application for a 30-month period (which can be shortened or extended\\nby the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge). If one or more of the NDA-listed patents are challenged, the first filer(s) of a Paragraph IV\\ncertification may be entitled to a 180-day period of market exclusivity over all other generic manufacturers.\\nGeneric manufacturers use Paragraph IV certifications extensively to challenge patents on innovative pharmaceuticals. In addition, generic companies\\nhave shown willingness to launch \"at risk,\" i.e., after receiving ANDA approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge.\\nUnder the BPCIA, the FDA cannot approve an application for a biosimilar product until data protection expires, 12 years after initial marketing approval of\\nthe innovator biologic, and an application may not be submitted until four years following the date the innovator biologic was first approved. However, the\\nBPCIA does provide a mechanism for a prospective biosimilar competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator\\'s patents as early as four years after\\ninitial marketing approval of the innovator biologic.\\nThe patent litigation scheme under the BPCIA, and the BPCIA itself, is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA, as well as\\nby courts. Courts have held that biosimilar applicants are not required to engage in the BPCIA patent litigation scheme and patent holders retain the right\\nto bring suit under normal patent law procedures if a biosimilar applicant attempts to commercialize a product prior to patent expiration. Further, in the\\nU.S., the increased likelihood of generic and biosimilar challenges to innovators\\' intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators\\' market\\nexclusivity. See also \"—Competition—Biosimilars.\" In addition, there is a procedure in U.S. patent law, known as inter partes review (IPR), which allows\\nany member of the public to file a petition with the USPTO seeking the review of any issued U.S. patent for validity. IPRs are conducted before\\nAdministrative Patent Judges in the USPTO using a lower standard of proof than used in federal district court. In addition, the challenged patents are not\\naccorded the presumption of validity as they are in federal district court. Generic drug companies and even some investment firms have engaged in the\\nIPR process in attempts to invalidate our patents. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman\\nAct is currently a topic of debate among legislators. We have also observed, and may continue to observe, changes at the Patent Trial and Appeal Board\\n(PTAB), including with respect to the PTAB\\'s policy to discretionarily deny an otherwise meritorious petition for IPR in light of a concurrent district court\\nproceeding.

Evolving regulatory priorities have intensified governmental scrutiny of our\\noperations, including with respect to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), quality assurance, and similar regulations. Compliance with the laws\\nand regulations affecting the manufacture and sale of current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products and uses will\\ncontinue to require substantial effort, expense, and capital investment.\\nOf particular importance to our business is regulation by the FDA in the U.S. Pursuant to laws and regulations that include the Federal Food, Drug, and\\nCosmetic Act, the FDA has jurisdiction over all of our products and devices in the U.S. and administers requirements covering the testing, safety,\\neffectiveness, manufacturing, quality control, distribution, labeling, marketing, promotion, advertising, dissemination of information, and post-marketing\\nsurveillance of those products and devices.\\nFollowing approval, our products remain subject to regulation by various agencies in connection with labeling, import, export, storage, recordkeeping,\\nadvertising, promotion, and safety reporting. We conduct extensive post-marketing surveillance of the safety of the products we sell. The FDA may\\nwithdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after a product reaches the market.\\nThe FDA also strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Pharmaceutical products may\\nbe promoted only for approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the\\nlaws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\\nOutside the U.S., our products and operations are subject to similar regulatory requirements, notably by the EMA in Europe, the Ministry of Health, Labor\\nand Welfare in Japan, and the National Medical Products Administration in China. Specific regulatory requirements vary from country to country.\\nRegulatory and compliance requirements, as well as approval processes outside the U.S., may differ from those in the U.S. and may involve additional\\ncosts, uncertainties, and risks.\\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies outside the U.S. extensively regulate all aspects of manufacturing quality for pharmaceuticals under their cGMP\\nregulations. We make substantial investments of capital and operating expenses to implement comprehensive, company-wide quality systems and\\ncontrols in our manufacturing, product development, and process development operations in an effort to maintain sustained compliance with cGMP and\\nother regulations. However, in the event we fail to adhere to these requirements, we become subject to potential government investigations, regulatory\\nand legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of\\nimport certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of\\nthe issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business. Certain of our products are manufactured by third parties, and their\\nfailure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect us, including through failure to supply product to us or delays in approvals of new products\\nor indications. Any determination by the FDA or other regulatory authorities of manufacturing or other deficiencies could adversely affect our business and\\nreputation.\\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may affect our\\nresearch, development or production efforts.\\n13\\n', 'Emergency Use Authorizations\\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services may issue an EUA to authorize unapproved medical products, or unapproved uses of approved medical\\nproducts, to be manufactured, marketed, and sold in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the government. An\\nEUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates, and EUAs can be revoked under other circumstances, the timing of\\nwhich may occur unexpectedly or be difficult to predict.\\nOutside the U.S., the emergency use of medical products is subject to regulatory processes and requirements that vary and differ from those in the U.S.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as a national emergency in the U.S. On the basis of such determination, the FDA granted EUAs for\\nbamlanivimab and etesevimab administered together, certain COVID-19-related uses of baricitinib, and bebtelovimab, and similar actions have been\\ntaken by other regulators in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. However, the FDA has revised, and may in the future further revise, these EUAs in\\nresponse to the changing conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as the prevalence of variants against which our antibodies have varying degrees of\\nefficacy. In May and November 2022, respectively, the FDA announced that bamlanivimab and etesevimab are, and bebtelovimab is, not currently\\nauthorized for emergency use for any U.S. region.\\nOther Laws and Regulations\\nThe marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with\\npurchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to various other U.S. federal and state laws, as well as analogous foreign laws and regulations,\\nincluding the federal anti-kickback statute, the False Claims Act, and state laws governing kickbacks, false claims, unfair trade practices, and consumer\\nprotection. These laws are administered by, among others, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and\\nHuman Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of Personnel Management, and state attorneys general. State, federal, and foreign\\ngovernments, agencies, and other regulatory bodies are active in their oversight, enforcement activities, and coordination with respect to pharmaceutical\\ncompanies, which has resulted in intensified scrutiny, litigation costs, corporate criminal sanctions, and substantial civil settlements in the pharmaceutical\\nindustry.\\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) prohibits certain individuals and entities, including U.S. publicly traded companies, from\\npromising, offering, or giving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the\\ncompany obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The FCPA also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal controls requirements\\non U.S. publicly traded companies. As noted above, our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with officials outside\\nthe U.S. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\\npurchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under\\nthe FCPA.\\nIn addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, the various jurisdictions in which we operate and supply our products have laws and\\nregulations aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. In recent years, several jurisdictions have enhanced their laws and\\nregulations in this area, increased their enforcement activities, and/or increased the level of cross-border coordination and information sharing.\\nWe are, and could in the future become, subject to administrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties\\n(including treble damages under the False Claims Act), criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from U.S. federal and other\\nhealthcare programs. It is possible that an adverse outcome in future actions could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of\\noperations, liquidity, and financial position in any given period.\\nWe are also subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign environmental, health and safety, and other laws and regulations that may affect our\\nresearch, development, or production efforts.\\n14\\n', \"Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\\nU.S.\\nThere continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing. In addition, U.S. government actions to reduce federal\\nspending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our\\nproducts.\\nIn August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA will require the U.S. Department\\nof Health and Human Services to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D.\\nGenerally, these government prices apply nine (medicines approved under an NDA) or thirteen (medicines approved under a Biologics License\\nApplication) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average\\nprices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell how the U.S. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price, but not\\na minimum or floor price. One or more of our significant products may be selected, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to\\npatent expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated\\nresults of operations. The establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would\\nsimilarly impact us.\\nOther IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a rate greater\\nthan the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer\\ndiscounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could\\nbe significant.\\nThe IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023, with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully influence our\\nbusiness strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under an NDA may reduce the\\nattractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a competitor’s product being selected for price setting are also\\nuncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation, and the full impact of the IRA on our business and the\\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.\\nHeightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which drug manufacturers price their marketed products has also resulted in several\\nCongressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product\\npricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for\\ndrug products. Restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments,\\nregulatory agencies, courts, or private payers could also adversely impact our business and financial results. For example, in April 2022, the Centers for\\nMedicare & Medicaid Services issued the Monoclonal Antibodies Directed Against Amyloid for the Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease national coverage\\ndetermination (the Alzheimer's Monoclonal Antibody NCD) limiting coverage of FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies that target amyloid for the treatment\\nof Alzheimer's disease for people with Medicare only if they are enrolled in qualifying clinical trials. In its current form, the Alzheimer’s Monoclonal\\nAntibody NCD would result in significantly reduced coverage for, and negatively impact, our product candidate donanemab, and may negatively impact\\nour business and financial results. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed or pursued by the U.S.\\nCongress, the current U.S. presidential administration, and regulatory authorities worldwide, could intensify these efforts and adversely impact our\\nbusiness and consolidated results of operations.\\n15\\n\", 'In the U.S., we are required to provide rebates to the federal government and state governments on their purchases of our pharmaceuticals under various\\nfederal and state healthcare programs, including state Medicaid and Medicaid Managed Care programs (minimum of 23.1 percent plus adjustments for\\nprice increases above the consumer price index over time) and discounts to private entities who treat patients in certain types of healthcare facilities\\nintended to serve low-income and uninsured patients (known as 340B covered entities). Additionally, an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical\\nmanufacturers and importers that sell branded prescription drugs to specified government programs. Since 2019, the Bipartisan Budget Act has required\\nmanufacturers of brand-name drugs, biologics, and biosimilars to provide a discount of 70 percent of the cost of branded prescription drugs for Medicare\\nPart D participants who are in the \"doughnut hole\" (the coverage gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage). Beginning in October 2024, under the IRA\\nthe 70 percent discount will be replaced by a 10 percent discount for all Medicare Part D beneficiaries that have met their deductible and incurred out of\\npocket drug costs below a $2,000 threshold and a 20 percent discount for beneficiaries that have incurred out of pocket drug costs above the $2,000\\nthreshold.\\nRebates are also negotiated in the private sector. We pay rebates to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors covered by\\nMedicare and to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to their customers. These rebates are affected by the introduction of competitive\\nproducts and generics in the same class. Our approach to the rebates we offer to private payers that provide prescription drug benefits to seniors\\ncovered by Medicare may be impacted by the 2020 regulatory amendments to the anti-kickback statute\\'s discount safe harbor, which have currently been\\nstayed until at least January 1, 2032.\\nFor a discussion of risks related to how we price our products, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We face litigation and\\ninvestigations related to our products, how we price our products, and how we commercialize our products; we could face large numbers of claims in the\\nfuture, which could adversely affect our business, and we are self-insured for such matters.\"\\nOutside the U.S.\\nGlobally, public and private payers are increasingly restricting access to pharmaceuticals based on assessments of comparative effectiveness and value,\\nincluding through the establishment of formal health technology assessment processes. In addition, third-party organizations, including professional\\nassociations, academic institutions, and non-profit entities associated with payers, conduct and publish comparative effectiveness and cost/benefit\\nanalyses on medicines, the impact of which are uncertain.\\nIn most international markets, we operate in an environment of government-mandated cost-containment programs, which may include price controls,\\ninternational reference pricing (to other countries\\' prices), discounts and rebates, therapeutic reference pricing (to other, often generic, pharmaceutical\\nchoices), restrictions on physician prescription levels, and mandatory generic substitution. In October 2022, the German Parliament passed cost cutting\\nreforms and these reforms were followed by activation of a clawback mechanism in France and implementation of increased mandatory rebates in the\\nUnited Kingdom. These changes may be followed in 2023 by biopharmaceutical-focused austerity measures in more countries in Europe and in other\\nmarkets. Reforms, including those that may stem from periods of economic downturn or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence or\\nescalation of, and responses to, war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war), or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic), may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\\nWe cannot predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative, regulatory, or payer developments.\\nHowever, in general we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing, resulting in additional state, federal, and international legislative and\\nregulatory developments that could have further negative effects on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\\nSee Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement,\\nand Access\" for additional information regarding recent legislative, administrative, and other pricing initiatives and their impact on our results.\\n16\\n', 'Research and Development\\nOur commitment to research and development dates back more than 140 years. We invest heavily in research and development because we believe it is\\ncritical to our long-term competitiveness. At the end of 2022, we employed approximately 9,000 people in pharmaceutical research and development\\nactivities, including a substantial number of physicians, scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees, and highly skilled technical personnel.\\nOur internal pharmaceutical research focuses primarily on the areas of obesity & diabetes, immunology, neuroscience, and oncology. At the outset of the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, we also focused on researching and developing potential treatments for COVID-19. In addition to discovering and developing new\\nmedicines, we seek to expand the value of existing products through new uses, formulations, and therapeutic approaches that provide additional value to\\npatients.\\nTo supplement our internal efforts, we collaborate with others, including academic institutions and research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology\\ncompanies. We use the services of physicians, hospitals, medical schools, and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to\\nestablish the safety and effectiveness of our medicines. We also invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen\\nour own efforts. These investments can take many forms, including, among others, licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion\\narrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments.\\nPharmaceutical development is time-consuming, expensive, and risky. Very few of the candidates discovered by researchers ultimately become approved\\nmedicines. The process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over a decade. Candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and even late-\\nstage candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success. The following describes in more detail the research and\\ndevelopment process for pharmaceutical products:\\nPhases of New Drug Development\\n•\\nDiscovery Phase\\nIn the discovery phase, scientists identify, design, and synthesize promising candidates by analyzing their effect on biological targets thought to play\\na role in disease. Targets are often unproven and only candidates that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criteria move to\\nthe next phase of development, which includes the initiation of studies in animals to support regulatory and safety requirements for clinical research\\nin humans. The discovery phase can take years and the probability of any one candidate becoming a medicine is extremely low.\\n•\\nEarly Development Phase\\nEarly development includes initial testing for safety and efficacy and early analyses of manufacturing requirements. Safety testing is initially\\nperformed in laboratory tests and animals, as necessary. In general, the first human tests (often referred to as Phase I) are conducted in small\\ngroups of subjects to assess safety and evaluate the potential dosing range. Subsequently, larger populations of patients are studied (Phase II) to\\nidentify initial signs of efficacy while continuing to assess safety. In parallel, scientists work to identify safe, effective, and economical manufacturing\\nprocesses. Long-term animal studies continue to test for potential safety issues. Of the candidates that enter the early development phase,\\napproximately 10 percent move to the late development phase. The early development phase varies but can take several years to complete.\\n•\\nLate Development Phase\\nLate phase development projects (typically Phase III) have met initial safety requirements and shown initial evidence of efficacy in earlier studies. As\\na result, these candidates generally have a higher likelihood of success and trials include larger patient populations to demonstrate safety and\\nefficacy in the disease. These studies are designed to demonstrate the benefit and risk of the potential new medicine and may be compared to\\ncompetitive therapies, placebo, or both. Phase III studies are generally conducted globally and are designed to support regulatory filings for\\nmarketing approval. The duration of Phase III testing varies by disease and may take two to four years.\\n17\\n', '•\\nSubmission Phase\\nOnce a potential new medicine is submitted to regulatory agencies, the time to final marketing approval can vary from several months to several\\nyears, depending on the disease state, the strength and complexity of available data, the degree of unmet need, and the time required for the\\nregulatory agency(ies) to evaluate the submission, which can depend on prioritization by regulators and other factors. There is no guarantee that a\\npotential medicine will receive marketing approval, or that decisions on marketing approvals or indications will be consistent across geographic\\nareas.\\nWe believe our investments in research, both internally and in collaboration with others, have resulted in a robust pipeline of potential new medicines and\\nnew treatment indications in all stages of development. We have a number of new medicine candidates in clinical development or under regulatory\\nreview, and we have a larger number of projects in the discovery phase. See Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—\\nLate-Stage Pipeline,\" for more information on our late-stage product candidates.\\nRaw Materials and Product Supply\\nMost of the principal materials we use in our manufacturing operations are available from more than one source. However, we obtain certain raw or\\nintermediate materials primarily from only one source. We generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source\\nof supply can be implemented, in the event one of these suppliers becomes unable to provide the materials or product. However, various developments\\nhave led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or shortages in supply until we establish new sources, implement alternative processes, bring new\\nmanufacturing facilities online, or pause or discontinue product sales in one or more markets.\\nThe majority of our revenue comes from products produced predominantly in our own facilities. Our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at\\nsites we own in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, and Ireland. Finishing operations, including formulation, filling, assembling, delivery device\\nmanufacturing, and packaging, take place at a number of sites throughout the world. We utilize third parties for certain active ingredient manufacturing\\nand finishing operations.\\nWe manage our supply chain (including our own facilities, contracted arrangements, and inventory) in a way that is intended to allow us to meet\\nsubstantially all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to changes\\nin supply and demand. To maintain supply of our products, we use a variety of techniques, including comprehensive quality systems, inventory\\nmanagement, and back-up sites.\\nHowever, pharmaceutical production processes are complex, highly regulated, and vary widely from product to product. Shifting or adding manufacturing\\ncapacity can be a very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditures, process modifications, and regulatory approvals. Accordingly,\\ndevelopments such as unplanned plant shutdowns, manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at one of our facilities or contracted facilities, failure or\\nrefusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, increases in demand on a supplier, or difficulties in predicting or variability\\nin demand for our products and those of our competitors have led, and may in the future lead, to interruption or higher costs in the supply of certain\\nproducts, product shortages, or pauses or discontinuations of product sales in one or more markets. Further, global transportation and logistics\\nchallenges, cost inflation, and tight labor markets, have caused, and in the future may cause, delays in and/or increased costs related to distribution of our\\nmedicines, the construction or acquisition of manufacturing capacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract manufacturer arrangements. For more\\ninformation on the additional risks we face in connection with any difficulties, disruptions, and shortages in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our\\nproducts, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Manufacturing, quality, or supply chain difficulties, disruptions, or shortages could\\nlead to product supply problems.\"\\nIn addition, cost inflation, the strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the\\nemergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine war), global economic downturns or uncertainty, and an\\nincrease in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business,\\nincluding increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines. For more information, see Item 1A, \"Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\\nBusiness—Public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and may in the future\\nadversely impact our business and operations.\" and Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—COVID-19\\nPandemic.\"\\n18\\n', 'Quality Assurance\\nOur success depends in great measure on customer confidence in the quality of our products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and\\neffectiveness. Product quality requires a total commitment to quality in all parts of our operations, including research and development, purchasing,\\nfacilities planning, manufacturing, distribution, and dissemination of information about our medicines.\\nQuality of production processes involves strict control of ingredients, equipment, facilities, manufacturing methods, packaging materials, and labeling. We\\nperform tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product in an effort to ensure that the product meets all applicable regulatory\\nrequirements and our internal standards. These tests may involve chemical and physical chemical analyses, microbiological testing, testing in animals, or\\na combination thereof. Additional assurance of quality is provided by quality assurance groups that audit and monitor all aspects of quality related to\\npharmaceutical manufacturing procedures and systems in company operations and at third-party suppliers.\\nExecutive Officers of the Company\\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our current executive officers.\\nThe term of office for each executive officer expires on the date of the annual meeting of the board of directors, to be held on May 1, 2023 in connection\\nwith the company\\'s annual meeting of shareholders, or on the date his or her successor is chosen and qualified.

We believe the strength of our workforce significantly contributes to our financial\\nperformance and enables us to make life better for people around the world. For instance, most of the products we sell today were discovered or\\ndeveloped by our own scientists, and our long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize\\ninnovative medicines. We believe that fostering a positive culture that values the contributions of our talented colleagues helps drive our success.\\nWe are committed to creating a safe, supportive, ethical, and rewarding work environment through strategic focus on our human capital management\\nprocess, fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, robust training and development opportunities, and competitive pay and benefits.\\nWe believe our dedication to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) within our company reflects our values and is a key driver of business\\nsuccess and growth.\\nWe regularly conduct anonymous employee surveys to seek feedback from our workforce on a variety of topics. These results are reviewed and analyzed\\nby our leaders to identify opportunities to adjust our policies and benefits to improve our employees' experience. As a result of our efforts, we believe that\\nwe have a highly performing, cohesive workforce and that our employee relations are good.\\nAt the end of 2022, we employed approximately 39,000 people, including approximately 21,000 employees outside the U.S. Our employees include\\napproximately 9,000 people engaged in research and development activities.\\nStrategy and Oversight\\nIn order to build diverse and inclusive teams, our CEO and executive committee set expectations for inclusive leadership and hold leaders accountable\\nfor achieving results. Because dedication to human capital management is also a core component of our corporate governance, our board of directors\\nregularly engages with management and facilitates a system of reporting designed to monitor human capital management initiatives and progress as part\\nof the overarching framework that guides how we attract, retain, engage, and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and mission.\\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\\nWe are committed to fairness and nondiscrimination in our employment practices, and we deeply value diverse backgrounds, skills, and global\\nperspectives. To fulfill our purpose, we believe we must look at challenges from multiple viewpoints and understand the diverse experiences of the\\npatients who depend on us.\\nWe believe that fostering DEI begins with understanding. For example, our Employee Journeys research has yielded important insights about the\\nexperiences of women, Black/African American, Latinx, Asian, and LGBTQ+ employees at Lilly. The results of this research are reviewed by our senior\\nleadership, and we deploy actions and activities in response to these insights to improve our workplace and corporate culture.\\nIn 2020, as part of our DEI and community initiatives, Lilly and the Lilly Foundation launched the Racial Justice Commitment, with Lilly pledging 25,000\\nvolunteer hours and the Lilly Foundation committing $25 million over five years to help decrease the burden of racial injustice and its effects on\\ncommunities of color. The Racial Justice Commitment aims to drive change across five areas: internal people development, health equity, social impact,\\ndiversity partners, and family sustaining jobs, through the use of financial and people resources. From 2020 through 2022, we have made progress in\\nthese efforts, including nearly tripling our spending with Black-owned businesses, committing over $98 million in minority-led venture capital firms, serving\\nover 30,000 volunteer hours to advance racial justice initiatives, and expanding our Skills First Program at Lilly for individuals without four-year college\\ndegrees.\\nSince 2017, we have committed to increasing women, Black/African American, Latinx, and Asian representation in leadership roles, and we actively\\nmonitor our progress. From the end of 2018 through the end of 2022, we increased the percentage of women in management globally from 42 percent to\\n49 percent. For minority group members (MGM) in the U.S. over the same period, we increased management representation from 19 percent to 25\\npercent. Across all levels of our workforce, from the end of 2018 through the end of 2022, we have seen increased representation for MGMs in the U.S.\\nand women globally. Our focus on DEI is also evident at our executive committee and board of directors. Five of 15 current members (approximately 33\\npercent) of our executive committee (which includes our CEO) are women and three are MGMs. In addition, as of the filing of this report, the company's\\n13-member board of directors includes five women and six members who are MGMs.\\n21\\n\", \"Our efforts in DEI and workplace benefits have garnered numerous recognitions, including, in 2022, Top 50 Companies for Diversity by DiversityInc., Top\\nCompanies for Board of Directors by DiversityInc., Top Companies for Supplier Diversity by DiversityInc., Top Companies for ESG by DiversityInc.,\\nAmerica's Best Employers for Women by Forbes, Perfect Score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation Corporate Equality Index, World's Most\\nEthical Companies by Ethisphere, Perfect Score on Disability Equity Index Best Places to Work by Disability:IN, Pharmaceutical Innovation Index, Zero\\nProject Award for Access Lilly, and Top Companies for Executive Women, Best Companies for Multicultural Women, Best Companies for Dads, 70\\npercent and Higher Inclusion Index by Seramount.\\nEmployee Development\\nWe believe attracting and retaining the best, diverse talent begins with the hiring process. We therefore require hiring managers to consider a diverse\\npool of candidates and we strive to provide a diverse panel of interviewers for open positions. We believe that hiring in this way helps ensure that people\\nfrom all backgrounds have equal opportunity to advance their careers.\\nIn early 2022, we launched Discover, a 12-month new employee onboarding program with multiple touchpoints designed to foster integration into Lilly, to\\naccelerate learning in their new roles and to create connections to further a sense of belonging at Lilly. Discover was shaped in part by external\\nbenchmarking, feedback from employees, and learnings from onboarding remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nWe offer training to enable our employees to perform their duties in our highly regulated industry. We also strive to cultivate a culture that promotes\\nongoing learning by encouraging employees to seek further education and growth experiences, helping them build rewarding careers. We have\\nintroduced online programming to facilitate access to our learning and development offerings in addition to our in-person programs. Many training courses\\nare designed to improve accessibility for people with disabilities and other unique needs. Across Lilly, we are continuously working to design learning\\nexperiences to be more inclusive and effective. In addition, we have implemented development tools and resources for all employees, improved our talent\\nprograms and processes to provide broader access to information, and increased transparency regarding career development and advancement at Lilly.\\nEmployee resource groups (ERGs) are another important component of developing talent at Lilly. We currently have 11 ERGs representing groups\\nincluding women, MGMs, LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans, and people with disabilities. ERGs offer our diverse workforce opportunities to build\\nrelationships, engage with senior leaders, advance our caring community, and offer unique insights and perspectives to improve our business.\\nWe have continued our efforts to create an inclusive workplace with the goal of ensuring that all employees feel safe to speak up and share their ideas at\\nwork. Our Make it Safe to Thrive education and awareness program is designed to help employees and leaders understand how individual psychological\\nsafety can be created and enhanced and includes live and online training. In late 2022, we introduced a new version of Make it Safe to Thrive for leaders\\nthat continues to focus on psychological safety and creating an inclusive environment. Leaders are provided the opportunity to work through challenging\\nconversations and situations currently being navigated in the workplace.\\nLilly is committed to fostering a culture of diversity and respect in the workplace—an environment free of discrimination, harassment, or retaliation of any\\nkind. In 2022, as part of our annual review of The Red Book and related policies and procedures, we revised the Global Conduct in the Workplace\\nprocedure to continue to help ensure that we maintain a respectful, safe, inclusive, and professional workplace.\\nEmployee Health and Safety\\nWe strive to foster a healthy, vibrant work environment, which includes keeping our employees safe. We seek to create a companywide culture where\\nbest-in-class safety practices are consistently followed. To do this, we assess and continuously attempt to improve our companywide safety performance\\nto promote the well-being of employees and to help safeguard communities where we operate. As the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved, we have\\ncontinued to take various measures (as necessary) to protect and support the health and safety of our employees globally. We believe a holistic approach\\nand dedication to safety helps us be our best as we deliver on our company purpose to improve lives around the world.\\n22\\n\", 'Information Available on Our Website\\nOur company website is www.lilly.com.

It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by\\nany of these risks. Certain of these risks could also adversely affect the company's reputation. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us\\nor that we currently believe to be immaterial could also adversely affect our business and reputation.\\nRisks Related to Our Business\\n•\\nPharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring\\ncommercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual\\nproperty protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies. \\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, the introduction of new products, and business\\ndevelopment activities to enhance our product pipeline.\\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a\\ndecade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As\\na result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development\\nmay fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain\\nnecessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approved uses, label\\nchanges, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to\\nmanufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and\\nsafety of new products and indications. Delays, uncertainties, unpredictabilities, and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and\\nagencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunity, potential impairment of inventories, and other negative impacts. In\\naddition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and indications.\\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such\\napproval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether\\nour products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\\nWe must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or line extensions for existing products, both through\\nour internal efforts and our business development activities, sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace\\nrevenues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual property exclusivity, or are displaced by competing\\nproducts or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,\\ncash flows, and financial position.\\nWe engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, co-development\\nagreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments. There are substantial risks associated with identifying\\nsuccessful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry,\\nincluding by the Federal Trade Commission and competition authorities in Europe and other jurisdictions, and heightened competition for attractive\\ntargets has and could continue to delay, jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition, failures or difficulties in\\nintegrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial\\noperations, compliance programs, information security, manufacturing, distribution, and general business operations and procedures) may affect our\\nability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or\\nrestructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to\\ndevelopments outside our control, including unsuccessful clinical trials, issues related to the quality, integrity, or broad applicability of data, regulatory\\nimpediments, and commercialization challenges. Accordingly, business\\n24\\n\", 'development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all), may not result in successful development outcomes or successful\\ncommercialization of any product, and may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny.\\nSee Item 1, \"Business—Research and Development—Phases of New Drug Development\" and Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—\\nExecutive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline,\" for more details about our current product pipeline.\\n•\\nWe depend on products with intellectual property protection for most of our revenues, cash flows, and earnings; the loss of effective\\nintellectual property protection for certain of our products has resulted, and in the future is likely to continue to result, in rapid and severe\\ndeclines in revenues for those products.\\nIn the ordinary course of their lifecycles, our products lose significant patent protection and/or data protection in the U.S., as well as in key\\njurisdictions outside the U.S., after a specified period of time. Some products also lose patent protection as a result of successful third-party\\nchallenges. We have faced, and remain exposed to, generic competition following the expiration or loss of such intellectual property protection. For\\nexample, following the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta in Europe and Japan in June 2021, we have faced generic competition that has\\nrapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenue from current levels in these\\nmarkets. In addition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity for Alimta in in\\nthe first half of 2022, we began facing, and expect to continue to face, generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior\\nlevels, and we expect will continue to erode revenue from current levels.\\nCertain other significant products no longer have effective exclusivity through patent protection or data protection. For non-biologic products, loss of\\nexclusivity (whether by expiration of legal rights or by termination thereof as a consequence of litigation) typically results in the entry of one or more\\ngeneric competitors, leading to a rapid and severe decline in revenues, especially in the U.S. For biologics (such as Humalog, Humulin, Erbitux,\\nCyramza, Trulicity, Taltz, and Emgality), loss of exclusivity may or may not result in the near-term entry of competitor versions (i.e., biosimilars) due to\\nmany factors, including development timelines, manufacturing challenges, and/or uncertainties regarding the regulatory pathways for approval of the\\ncompetitor versions. Generic pharmaceutical companies could also introduce a generic product before resolution of any related patent litigation.\\nThere is no assurance that the patents we are seeking will be granted or that the patents we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged.\\nMoreover, patents relating to particular products, uses, formulations, or processes do not preclude other manufacturers from employing alternative\\nprocesses or marketing alternative products or formulations that compete with our patented products. In addition, competitors or other third parties\\nmay assert claims that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them, or allege a third-party right of ownership in our\\nexisting intellectual property. See Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters,\" and Item\\n1, \"Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" for more details.\\n•\\nOur long-term success depends on intellectual property protection; if our intellectual property rights are invalidated, circumvented, or\\nweakened, our business will be adversely affected.\\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to continually discover or acquire, develop, and commercialize innovative medicines. Without strong\\nintellectual property protection, we would be unable to generate the returns necessary to support our significant investments in research and\\ndevelopment, as well as the other expenditures required to bring new drugs and indications to the market. Intellectual property protection varies\\nthroughout the world and is subject to change over time, depending on local laws and regulations. Changes to such laws, regulations, and\\nenforcement practices could reduce protections for our innovative products and indications. For example, potential reforms to pharmaceutical\\nlegislation in the European Union may threaten the predictability and length of certain pharmaceutical intellectual property incentives. Changes\\nproposed by the USPTO to limit the number of, and differences between, patents obtained could also affect the scope of patent protection for our\\nproducts in the U.S. Also in the U.S., in addition to the process for challenging patents set forth in the BPCIA, which applies to biologic products, the\\nHatch-Waxman Act provides generic companies substantial incentives to seek to invalidate our patents covering pharmaceutical products. As a\\nresult, we expect that our U.S. patents on major pharmaceutical products, including biologics, will continue to be routinely challenged in litigation\\n25\\n', 'and may not be upheld. In addition, a separate IPR process currently allows competitors to seek invalidation of patents at the USPTO without the\\nprotections of the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman Act. The use of IPR proceedings after the institution of litigation pursuant to the BPCIA or Hatch-Waxman\\nAct is currently a topic of debate among legislators and the future ability of our competitors to use IPR proceedings as an alternative to Hatch-\\nWaxman Act or BPCIA litigation procedures to challenge our patents remains uncertain. Recently, the USPTO issued an interim procedure regarding\\nthe use of discretionary denials of IPR proceedings when there is parallel district court litigation. However, it is not clear how this interim procedure\\ncould affect the ability of our competitors to institute IPR proceedings after institution of litigation. If our patents are challenged through this expedited\\nreview process, even if we prevail in demonstrating the validity of our patent, our win provides limited precedential value at the PTAB and no\\nprecedential value in federal district court, meaning the same patent can be challenged by other competitors. We face many generic manufacturer\\nchallenges to our patents outside the U.S. as well. The entry of generic competitors typically results in rapid and severe declines in revenues. In\\naddition, competitors or other third parties may claim that our activities infringe patents or other intellectual property rights held by them. If successful,\\nsuch claims could result in our being unable to market a product in a particular territory or being required to pay significant damages for past\\ninfringement or royalties on future sales. In addition, intellectual property protection in certain jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weak and we face\\nadditional risks to our intellectual property rights, including competition with generic or counterfeit versions of our products relatively shortly after\\nlaunch. See Item 1, \"Business—Patents, Trademarks, and Other Intellectual Property Rights,\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary\\nData—Note 16: Contingencies,\" for more details.\\n•\\nWe and our products face intense competition from multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and lower-cost\\ngeneric and biosimilar manufacturers, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business.\\nWe compete with a large number of multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and generic pharmaceutical companies and,\\nin many cases, our products compete against the leading products of one or more of our competitors. To compete successfully, we must continue to\\ndeliver to the market innovative, cost-effective products that meet important medical needs. Our product revenues can be adversely affected by the\\nintroduction by competitors of branded products that are perceived as superior by the marketplace, by generic or biosimilar versions of our branded\\nproducts, and by generic or biosimilar versions of other products in the same therapeutic class as our branded products. Our revenues can also be\\nadversely affected by treatment innovations, including new modalities, that eliminate or minimize the need for treatment with our drugs.\\nRegulation of generic and biosimilar products varies around the world and such regulation is complex and subject to ongoing interpretation and\\nimplementation by regulatory agencies and courts. Particularly for biosimilars, health authority guidelines and legislative actions could make it less\\nburdensome for competitor products to enter the market and further incentivize uptake of biosimilars. In the U.S., the FDA has issued several\\n\"interchangeability\" designations for biosimilar products, and is expected to continue doing so in the future. These designations could – subject to\\nstate law requirements – enable pharmacies to substitute biosimilars for innovator biological products. Given the importance of biologic products to\\nour clinical-stage pipeline, such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. See Item 1, \"Business—Competition\" and \"Business\\n—Research and Development,\" for more details.\\nIn addition, we rely on our ability to attract, engage, and retain highly qualified and skilled personnel in order to compete effectively. To continue to\\ncommercialize our products, and advance the research, development, and commercialization of additional modalities, indications, and product\\ncandidates, we have expanded, and will likely need to further expand, our workforce, including in the areas of manufacturing, clinical trials\\nmanagement, regulatory affairs, and sales and marketing, both in and outside the U.S. We continue to face intense competition for qualified\\nindividuals from numerous multinational pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic and other research institutions, as well as\\nemployers near our manufacturing and other facilities, which has and may continue to increase our labor costs. Our ability to attract and retain talent\\nin our increasingly competitive environment may be further complicated by evolving employment trends, including as related to increased preferences\\nfor remote or flexible work arrangements; public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; political, social, civil,\\nor cultural unrest; emergence or escalation of, and responses to, war and unrest; or the threat of or perceived potential for any of the foregoing\\nevents. Our failure to compete effectively for talent could negatively affect sales of our current and any future\\n26\\n', 'approved products, and could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our business.\\n•\\nFailure, inadequacy, breach of, or unauthorized access to, our IT systems or those of our third-party service providers, unauthorized\\naccess to our confidential information, or violations of data protection laws, could each result in material harm to our business and\\nreputation.\\nA great deal of confidential information owned by us or our business partners or other third parties is stored in our information systems, networks, and\\nfacilities or those of third parties. This includes valuable trade secrets and intellectual property, clinical trial information, corporate strategic plans,\\nmarketing plans, customer information, and personally identifiable information, such as employee and patient information (collectively, confidential\\ninformation). We also rely, to a large extent, on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems, infrastructure,\\nand hardware (together, IT systems), some of which are within our control and some of which are within the control of third parties, to accumulate,\\nprocess, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information and other data. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and\\ndeveloping laws and regulations around the world related to privacy, data protection, and data security. Maintaining the security, confidentiality,\\nintegrity, and availability of our IT systems and confidential information is vital to our business. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party service\\nproviders, to protect and maintain the security, confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our (or their) IT systems and our confidential information and\\nother data could significantly harm our reputation as well as result in significant costs, including those related to fines, litigation, and obligations to\\ncomply with applicable data breach laws.\\nIT systems are vulnerable to system inadequacies, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or\\ncyber-attacks from a variety of sources, which may remain undetected for significant periods of time. Such vulnerabilities, inadequacies, or failures\\nare in many cases more acute for IT systems associated with recently acquired businesses, and we may be unable to address such vulnerabilities,\\ninadequacies, or failures immediately after acquiring a business. As a result, our newly acquired businesses could be more vulnerable to potential\\ninterruptions, breaches, intrusions, or attacks.\\nCyber-attacks are growing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect, mitigate, or prevent.\\nCyber-attacks come in many forms, including the deployment of harmful malware, exploitation of vulnerabilities (including those of third-party software\\nor systems), denial-of-service attacks, the use of social engineering, and other means to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of\\nour IT systems, confidential information, and other data. Breaches resulting in the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft,\\ndestruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with our IT\\nsystems, products and services, can occur in a variety of ways, including negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access\\nto our systems and information, or wrongful conduct by hackers, competitors, certain governments or nation-states, or other current or former\\ncompany personnel. Our third-party partners, including third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as suppliers, distributors,\\nalliances, and other third parties with whom we may share data, face similar risks, which could affect us directly or indirectly. Unassociated third\\nparties present further risks, including by propagating misinformation related to our products, business, and industry. The healthcare industry has\\nbeen and continues to be a target for cyber-attacks, and the number of threats has increased over time. Numerous federal agencies that monitor and\\nregulate internet and cyber-crime have issued guidance, alerts and directives warning of software vulnerabilities that require immediate patching,\\nmalicious actors targeting healthcare-related systems and nation-state sponsored hacking designed to steal valuable information.\\nThe failure, inadequacy, or breach of our IT systems or business processes, the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft,\\ndestruction, or unauthorized access to, disclosure or use of, confidential information, or the unauthorized access to, disruption of, or interference with\\nour products and services that rely on IT systems or business processes, could impair our ability to secure and maintain intellectual property rights;\\nresult in a product manufacturing interruption or failure, or in the interruption or failure of products or services that rely on IT systems or business\\nprocesses; damage our operations, customer relationships, or reputation; undermine integration activities or otherwise delay the launch of acquired\\nproducts; result in unfavorable clinical trial results by virtue of incorrect or unreliable data; and/or cause us to lose trade secrets or other competitive\\nadvantages. Unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could expose us to significant sanctions for violations of data privacy laws\\nand\\n27\\n', 'regulations around the world and could damage public trust in our company. In addition, IT system security in jurisdictions outside the U.S. is weaker\\nand may result in additional costs, uncertainties, and risks.\\nTo date, system inadequacies, operating failures, unauthorized access, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions,\\ncyber-attacks, and the compromise, disruption, degradation, manipulation, loss, theft, destruction, or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential\\ninformation have not had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations. We maintain cyber liability insurance; however, this insurance\\nmay not be sufficient to cover the financial, legal, business, or reputational losses that may result from an interruption or breach of our IT systems. We\\ncontinue to implement measures in an effort to protect, detect, respond to, and minimize or prevent these risks and to enhance the resiliency of our IT\\nsystems; however, these measures may not be successful and we may fail to detect or remediate security breaches, malicious intrusions, cyber-\\nattacks, or other compromises of our systems. Any of these events could result in material financial, legal, commercial, or reputational harm to our\\nbusiness.\\n•\\nEconomic downturns or international trade and other global disruptions or disputes could adversely affect our business and operating\\nresults. \\nEconomic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products, affecting our sales. Declining tax revenues and increased government\\nspending on other programs attributable to economic downturns increase the pressure on governments to reduce healthcare spending, leading to\\nincreased control of drug prices or lower utilization. Additionally, some customers, including governments or other entities reliant upon government\\nfunding, may be unable to pay for our products fully or in a timely manner. Also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience\\nfinancial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or\\ncollaboration partners. Similarly significant economic downturns could limit our ability to access capital markets.\\nIn addition, significant portions of our business are conducted in Europe (including the United Kingdom), Asia (including China), and other\\ninternational geographies. Trade and other global disputes and interruptions in international relationships, including related to tariffs, trade protection\\nmeasures, import or export licensing requirements, the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other governments, unrest or\\nwar, as well as public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, affect our ability to do business. For example,\\ntensions between the U.S. and China have led to a series of tariffs and sanctions being imposed by the U.S. on imports from China mainland, as well\\nas other business restrictions. As a further example, the financial impact of higher energy prices, defense spending, and inflation due, in part, to the\\nRussia-Ukraine war and resulting geopolitical and economic disruptions, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic, has further exacerbated\\nfinancial pressures on governments with single-payer or government funded healthcare systems, leading to increased impetus for increases in\\nrebates, clawbacks, and other reforms to reimbursement systems, particularly in Europe. These and similar events have adversely affected, and may\\ncontinue to adversely affect, us, our business partners, and our customers. For more details, see Item 1, \"Business—Regulations and Private Payer\\nActions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access.\" \\n•\\nPharmaceutical products can develop unexpected safety or efficacy concerns, which could have a material adverse effect on our\\nrevenues, income, and reputation. \\nPharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. After approval, the\\nproducts are used for longer periods of time by much larger numbers of patients. Accordingly, we and others (including regulatory agencies and\\nprivate payers) collect extensive information on the efficacy and safety of our marketed products by continuously monitoring the use of our products in\\nthe marketplace. In addition, we or others may conduct post-marketing clinical studies on efficacy and safety of our marketed products. New safety or\\nefficacy data from both market surveillance and post-marketing clinical studies may result in product label changes or other measures that could\\nreduce the product\\'s market acceptance and result in declining sales. Serious safety or efficacy issues that arise after product approval have, and\\ncould in the future, result in voluntary or mandatory product recalls or withdrawals from the market. Safety issues have, and could in the future, result\\nin costly product liability claims.\\n28\\n', '•\\nWe face litigation and investigations related to our products, how we price our products, and how we commercialize our products; we\\ncould face large numbers of claims in the future, which could adversely affect our business, and we are self-insured for such matters.\\nWe are subject to a substantial number of claims involving various current and historical products, litigation and investigations. These claims relate to\\nhow we commercialize and/or how we price our products, including relating to our 340B drug pricing program, as well as contractual matters and\\nother disputes. See Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies\" for more information on our current product\\nliability litigation, as well as pricing and other litigation, investigations, and inquiries. Because of the nature of pharmaceutical products, we are, and\\ncould in the future become, subject to large numbers of product liability claims for our previous, current, or future products, or to further litigation or\\ninvestigations, including related to pricing or other commercial practices. Such matters could affect our results of operations or require us to recognize\\nsubstantial charges to resolve and, if involving marketed products, could adversely affect sales of the product and our consolidated results of\\noperations in any given period. Due to a very restrictive market for liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all of our\\ncurrently marketed products, as well as for litigation or investigations related to our pricing practices or other similar matters.\\n•\\nManufacturing, quality, or supply chain difficulties, disruptions, or shortages could lead to product supply problems. \\nPharmaceutical manufacturing is complex and highly regulated. Manufacturing or quality assurance difficulties at our facilities or those of our\\ncontractors and suppliers, the failure or refusal of a supplier or contract manufacturer to supply contracted quantities, or increases in demand on a\\nsupplier could result in delays and disruptions in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products and/or product shortages, leading to lost\\nrevenue. In select cases, supply constraints may also lead to pauses, discontinuations or other product availability issues in one or more markets,\\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and cash flows. Further, cost inflation and global transportation\\nand logistics challenges, as well as tight labor markets, have caused, and in the future may cause, delays in, and/or increase costs related to,\\ndistribution of our medicines, the construction or other acquisition of manufacturing capacity, procurement activity, and supplier or contract\\nmanufacturer arrangements. Such difficulties, disruptions, or challenges could result from quality, oversight, or regulatory compliance problems;\\nnatural disasters (including increased instances of natural disasters or other events that may be due to climate change), public health outbreaks,\\nepidemics, or pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic); periods of global economic downturn or uncertainty; emergence or escalation of, and\\nresponses to, war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war); equipment, mechanical, data, or IT system vulnerabilities, such as system\\ninadequacies, inadequate controls or procedures, operating failures, service interruptions or failures, security breaches, malicious intrusions, or\\ncyber-attacks from a variety of sources; labor shortages; contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; or inability to obtain\\nsingle-source or other raw or intermediate materials. Regional dependencies may in some cases accentuate risks related to manufacturing and\\nsupply. For example, we, and the pharmaceutical industry generally, depend on China-based partners for integral chemical synthesis, reagents,\\nstarting materials, and ingredients.\\nDifficulties in predicting or variability in demand for our products and those of our competitors and the very long lead times necessary for the\\nexpansion and regulatory qualification of pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity have resulted, and in the future may result, in difficulty meeting\\ndemand for, or disruptions, shortages, and higher costs in the supply of, our products. For example, we have experienced challenges in meeting\\ndemand for our incretin products, partially due to the limited availability of competitor therapies. Despite our ongoing efforts to meet significant\\nexpected demand by obtaining additional internal and contracted manufacturing capacity, there can be no assurances that such capacity increases\\nwill be realized as expected. Delays or challenges in operationalizing additional manufacturing capacity would limit our ability to capitalize on\\nexpected demand. Conversely, unexpected contingencies that limit demand for our incretin products would undermine our ability to realize the full\\nbenefit of significant capital expenditures that we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, to augment manufacturing capacity and may also\\nsubject us to contractual payment obligations. The foregoing risks and uncertainties could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations\\nand reputation. See Item 1, \"Business—Raw Materials and Product Supply,\" and Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Financial\\nCondition and Liquidity\" for more details.\\n29\\n', '•\\nWe derive a significant percentage of our total revenue from relatively few products and sell our products through increasingly\\nconsolidated supply chain stakeholders, which may subject us to, or exacerbate, various risks.\\nWe derived direct product and/or alliance revenues of more than $1 billion for each of Trulicity, Verzenio, Taltz, Jardiance (including Glyxambi,\\nSynjardy, and Trijardy XR), Humalog (including Insulin Lispro), our COVID-19 antibodies, and Humulin that collectively accounted for 69 percent of\\nour total revenues in 2022. In particular, Trulicity accounted for 26 percent of our total revenues in 2022 and we expect GLP-1s, including Mounjaro,\\nwhich we launched in 2022, to represent a significant and growing portion of our business. Loss of patent protection, changes in prescription rates,\\nmaterial product liability litigation, unexpected side effects or safety concerns, significant changes in demand, regulatory proceedings, negative\\npublicity affecting doctor or patient confidence, pressure from existing or new competitive products, changes in labeling, pricing, and access\\npressures, or supply shortages or disruptions for these products or any of our other major products could materially impact our results of operations.\\nIn addition, in the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers and if one of these significant wholesalers should encounter financial\\nor other difficulties, it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler does with us or we might be unable to timely collect the amounts that\\nthe wholesaler owes us, which could negatively impact our results of operations. See Item 1, “Business—Marketing and Distribution,” for more\\ndetails.\\nMoreover, the negotiating power of health plans, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, and other supply chain stakeholders has\\nincreased due to consolidation, regulatory, and other market impacts, and they, along with governments, increasingly employ formularies to control\\ncosts and encourage utilization of certain drugs, including through the use of formulary inclusion, or favorable formulary placement. Such\\nstakeholders have also increasingly imposed utilization management tools favoring the use of generic products. As these practices expand, including\\ndue to potential further consolidation of U.S. private third-party payers, we may face difficulty in obtaining or maintaining timely or adequate pricing or\\nformulary placement of our products. We expect that consolidation of supply chain stakeholders will continue to increase competitive and pricing\\npressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers. For additional information on pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products, see \"U.S.\\nPrivate Sector Dynamics\" and \"Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access—U.S.\"\\n•\\nReliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adversely affect our business.\\nWe rely on third parties, including suppliers, distributors, alliances, and collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and\\nthird-party service providers, for selected aspects of product and clinical development, manufacturing, commercialization, hosting of, and support for,\\nIT systems, product distribution, and certain financial transactional processes. As examples, we outsource the day-to-day management and oversight\\nof some of our clinical trials to contract research organizations and the distribution of our products through logistics providers. Outsourcing involves\\nmany risks, including the risk that the third parties may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, including applicable requirements for\\ndiversity in clinical trials; may not produce reliable results; may not perform in a timely manner; may not maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and\\navailability of confidential and proprietary information relating to us, our clinical trial subjects, or patients; may experience disruption or fail to perform\\ndue to IT system vulnerabilities, breaches, cyber-attacks, or inadequate controls or procedures; may be unable to satisfy their commitments to us in\\nwhich case we may not be able to achieve acceptable alternative sourcing; or may fail to perform at all. The foregoing risks may be heightened in\\njurisdictions outside the U.S., where we may have fewer alternative providers as well as face additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. Failure of third\\nparties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, privacy, security, or other obligations to us, our clinical trial subjects, and our patients\\ncould have a material adverse effect on our business.\\n•\\nPublic health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and may in the future\\nadversely impact our business and operations.\\nActual or threatened public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and may in the\\nfuture adversely impact our business and operations. The\\n30\\n', 'COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations across markets to varying and\\nfluctuating degrees, including as a result of:\\n•\\nCost inflation and strain on global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, which have negatively impacted development,\\nmanufacturing, supply, distribution, and sales of our medicines, including through increased costs to provide, and in some cases disruptions in\\nsupply or shortages of, our medicines.\\n•\\nFewer in-person interactions among patients and healthcare providers and our employees with healthcare professionals in certain markets.\\n•\\nPricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting, in part, from the financial strain of\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare systems around the world.\\n•\\nRisks related to our COVID-19 therapies, including heightened regulatory scrutiny of our manufacturing practices, quality assurance, and similar\\nregulations; restrictions on administration that limit widespread and timely access to our therapies, and risks related to handling, return, and/or\\nrefund of product after delivery by us; concerns related to expedited authorization of restricted distribution of products with less than typical safety\\nand efficacy data; and fluctuations in, or elimination of, demand for our COVID-19 therapies, including based on the availability of superior or\\ncompetitive therapies, preventative measures such as vaccines and antiviral medicines, mutations of the virus impacting effectiveness,\\nrevocations or restrictions on EUAs, reaching endemic status in different jurisdictions, reduced government and payer funding for COVID-19\\ntherapies, the unpredictable nature of pandemics, and other developments.\\nThese and other risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and other actual or threatened public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics could\\naffect other aspects of our business or intensify other risks inherent in our business. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to\\naffect us and other actual or threatened public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics could affect us, will depend on developments that are\\nhighly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the public health threat, the actions taken to reduce its\\ntransmission, the introduction and spread of new variants, the degree and extent of government restrictions on economic activity, government\\nspending, and access to healthcare, and the speed with which, and extent to which, economic and operating conditions recover. Should the COVID-\\n19 pandemic, or any other actual or threatened public health outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic, as well as any associated or resulting cost of inflation,\\nsupply chain disruption, labor market impact, recession, depression, or other negative contingency, continue for a prolonged period, these risks could\\nbe exacerbated, causing further impact on our business and operations.\\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\\n•\\nOur business is subject to increasing government price controls and other public and private restrictions on pricing, reimbursement, and\\naccess for our drugs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, reputation or business. \\nPublic and private payers continue to take aggressive steps to control their expenditures for pharmaceuticals by placing restrictions on pricing and\\nreimbursement for, and patient access to, our medicines. These pressures have negatively affected, and could continue to negatively affect, our\\nconsolidated results of operations. Governments and private payers worldwide have intensified their scrutiny of, and actions intended to address,\\npricing, reimbursement, and access to pharmaceutical products. Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including as a result of\\nthe regulatory priorities of the current U.S. presidential administration and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and\\nconsolidated results of operations. In particular, if one or more of our significant products are selected under the IRA, the resulting price reduction and\\nreimbursement could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. For more details, see Item 1, \"Business—Regulations\\nand Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access.\"\\nFurther, restrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments,\\nregulatory agencies, courts, or private payers, such as the Alzheimer’s Monoclonal Antibody NCD, may adversely impact our business and financial\\nresults. We\\n31\\n', 'continue to experience additional pricing pressures, rebates, clawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies and programs resulting from\\nthe financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic, periods of global economic downturn or uncertainty, and the emergence or escalation of, and\\nresponses to, war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war).\\nFor more details, see Item 1, \"Business—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access,\"\\nItem 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Trends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement,\\nand Access,\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16: Contingencies.\"\\n•\\nChanges in foreign currency rates, interest rate risks, or inflation affect our results of operations.\\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, interest rate risk from our exposure to floating\\nand variable interest rates, and inflation risk from existing and expected rates of inflation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, each of which impacts our\\nresults of operations. In recent periods, significant fluctuations in currency rates and inflation have had a significant negative impact on our results of\\noperations. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and our results of operations may continue to be adversely impacted if the U.S. dollar remains\\nstrong compared to foreign currencies. Further, in the event of an extreme devaluation of local currency in a particular market in which we operate,\\nthe price of our products could become unsustainable in the relevant market. Inflationary pressures in recent periods have also negatively impacted\\nus and may continue to negatively impact us in various ways, including cost inflation, higher labor costs, and other higher expenses, with some of\\nthese higher expenses due in part to policy actions intended to curb inflation. See Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Financial\\nCondition and Liquidity\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and\\nImplementation of New Financial Accounting Standards,\" for more details.\\n•\\nWe are subject to evolving and complex tax laws, which may result in additional liabilities and affect our results of operations. \\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions, and in the course of our business, we make judgments about the\\nexpected tax treatment of various transactions and events. Changes in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations,\\nas well as events that differ from our expectations, have affected and may adversely affect our effective tax rates, cash flows, and/or results of\\noperations. Significant uncertainty currently exists regarding tax proposals introduced by the current U.S. administration and Congress, including\\nmodifications to certain aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, such as the potential repeal or deferral of the provision requiring capitalization\\nof research and development expenses. In addition, tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our\\ntax returns and are intensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions, which could unfavorably impact our results of\\noperations. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters by associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\\nDevelopment and the European Commission could influence tax laws in countries in which we operate. Modifications to key elements of the current\\nU.S. or international tax framework could have a significant impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. See Item 7,\\n\"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Tax Matters\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary\\nData—Note 14: Income Taxes,\" for more details.\\n•\\nRegulatory compliance problems could be damaging to the company.\\nThe marketing, promotional, and pricing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers, as well as the manner in which manufacturers interact with\\npurchasers, prescribers, and patients, are subject to extensive scrutiny and regulation. Many companies, including us, are and have been subject to\\ninvestigations and claims related to these practices asserted by federal, state, and foreign governmental authorities, private payers, and consumers.\\nThese investigations and claims have resulted in substantial expense and other significant consequences to us. We are, and could in the future\\nbecome, subject to such investigations and claims, the outcomes of which include criminal charges and fines, penalties, or other monetary or non-\\nmonetary remedies, including exclusion from U.S. federal and other healthcare programs. Such investigations and claims have intensified and may\\ncontinue to intensify as a result of the regulatory priorities of each particular U.S. presidential administration and other regulatory authorities\\nworldwide. In addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with cGMP, quality assurance, evolving standards, and increased scrutiny around\\nexcipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and\\n32\\n', 'similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and standards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions,\\nproduct recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to product shortages, import bans or denials of import\\ncertifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental approvals of current products pending resolution of the\\nissues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business. Regulatory compliance and processes in jurisdictions outside the\\nU.S. may also be less predictable and result in additional costs, uncertainties, and risks. See Item 1, \"Business—Government Regulation of Our\\nOperations,\" for more details.\\nFurthermore, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies\\nrelating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, sustainable manufacturing, human rights\\nand equity matters, and disclosure regarding the foregoing, many of which may be ambiguous, inconsistent, dynamic or conflicting. We expect to\\nexperience increased restrictions and compliance costs, legal costs, and expenses related to such new or changing legal or regulatory requirements.\\nMoreover, compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements would require us to devote substantial time and attention to these matters. In\\naddition, we may still be subject to penalties or potential litigation if such laws and regulations are interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with\\nour practices.\\nAdditionally, we are subject to increased negative attention from the media, stockholders, activists, and other stakeholders on climate change, social,\\nand sustainability matters. The perception that we have failed to act in a socially responsible manner, whether or not valid, results in adverse\\npublicity that can negatively affect our business and reputation, as well as result in increased scrutiny from legislators and regulatory authorities.\\nMoreover, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and commitments, including to reduce our impact on the environment. Our\\nability to achieve any stated environmental, social or governance goal, target or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of\\nwhich are outside our control. Examples of such factors include evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures or\\nimposing different requirements, the availability of requisite financing, and the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other goals.\\nIf we fail to achieve, are perceived to have failed or been delayed in achieving, or improperly report our progress toward achieving these goals and\\ncommitments, it could negatively affect our reputation or investor confidence, and expose us to enforcement actions and litigation.\\n33\\n', 'Item 1B.Unresolved Staff Comments\\nNone.\\nItem 2.

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and\\noften costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most\\nfunds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach\\nthe market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory\\napprovals or payer reimbursement or coverage, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the\\nrelevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the\\npatents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications.\\nDelays, uncertainties, unpredictabilities, and inconsistencies in drug approval processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product\\nlaunches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of or variability in demand for new products and\\nindications.\\nWe manage research and development spending across our portfolio of potential new medicines. A delay in, or termination of, any one project will not\\nnecessarily cause a significant change in our total research and development spending. Due to the risks and uncertainties involved in the research and\\ndevelopment process, we cannot reliably estimate the nature, timing, and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our research and\\ndevelopment projects, nor can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from any successful research and development\\nproject. Each project represents only a portion of the overall pipeline, and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development\\nexpense. While we do accumulate certain research and development costs on a project level for internal reporting purposes, we must make significant\\ncost estimations and allocations, some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanisms. Therefore,\\nwe do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development costs by project, by preclinical versus clinical spend, or by\\ntherapeutic category.\\n® (1)\\n(2)\\n®\\n(2)\\n(2)\\n®\\n(1) \\n(2) \\n41\\n', \"Other Matters\\nPatent Matters\\nWe depend on patents or other forms of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue, cash flows, and earnings.\\nFollowing the expiration of patent exclusivity for Alimta  in Europe and Japan in June 2021, we have faced generic competition that has rapidly and\\nseverely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect such competition will continue to erode revenues from current levels in these markets. In\\naddition, as a result of the entry of multiple generics in the U.S. following the expiration of patent and pediatric exclusivity in the first half of 2022, we\\nbegan facing, and expect to continue to face, generic competition that has rapidly and severely eroded revenue from prior levels, and we expect will\\ncontinue to erode revenue from current levels. This decline in revenue will continue to impact period-over-period financial results comparisons,\\nparticularly during the first half of 2023. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings currently pending\\nregarding certain of our patents.\\nOur compound patents for Humalog  (insulin lispro) have expired in the U.S. and major international markets, and we have also introduced lower-priced\\nversions of Humalog as part of our insulin access and affordability solutions. A competitor has a similar version of insulin lispro in the U.S. and in certain\\nEuropean markets. Due to the impact of competition and pricing pressure in the U.S. and certain international markets, we expect that lower revenue for\\nHumalog due to realized price decline will continue over time.\\nTrends Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\\nReforms, including those that may stem from periods of economic downturn or uncertainty, or as a result of high inflation, emergence or escalation of, and\\nresponses to, war or unrest (including the Russia-Ukraine war), or government budgeting priorities (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19\\npandemic), may continue to result in added pressure on pricing and reimbursement for our products.\\nGlobal concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical products continues to drive regulatory and legislative debate and action, as well as\\nworldwide cost containment efforts by governmental authorities. Such measures include the use of mandated discounts, price reporting requirements,\\nmandated reference prices, restrictive formularies, changes to available intellectual property protections, as well as other efforts. In August 2022, the U.S.\\ngovernment enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). Among other measures, the IRA will require the U.S. Department of Health and Human\\nServices to effectively set prices for certain single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed under Medicare Part B and Part D. Generally, these\\ngovernment prices apply nine (medicines approved under a New Drug Application) or thirteen (medicines approved under a Biologics License\\nApplication) years following initial FDA approval and will be capped at a statutory ceiling price that is likely to represent a significant discount from average\\nprices to wholesalers and direct purchasers. It is too soon to tell how the U.S. government will set these prices as the law specifies a ceiling price, but not\\na minimum or floor price. One or more of our significant products may be selected, which would have the effect of accelerating revenue erosion prior to\\npatent expiry. The effect of reducing prices and reimbursement for certain of our products would significantly impact our business and consolidated\\nresults of operations. The establishment of payment limits or other restrictions by drug affordability review boards and other state level actors would\\nsimilarly impact us.\\nOther IRA provisions provide for rebate obligations on drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D medicines at a rate greater\\nthan the rate of inflation and Part D benefit redesign that includes replacing the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new manufacturer\\ndiscounting program. Manufacturers that fail to comply with the IRA may be subject to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties, which could\\nbe significant.\\nThe IRA takes effect progressively starting in 2023, with the first government-set prices effective in 2026. The IRA may meaningfully influence our\\nbusiness strategies and those of our competitors. In particular, the nine-year timeline to set prices for medicines approved under a new drug application\\nmay reduce the attractiveness of investment in small molecule innovation. The implications to us of a competitor's product being selected for price setting\\nare also uncertain. Provisions of the IRA may be subject to legal challenges or other reformation, and the full impact of the IRA on our business and the\\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain.\\n®\\n®\\n42\\n\", 'Additional policies, regulations, legislation, or enforcement, including those proposed and/or pursued by the U.S. Congress, the current U.S. presidential\\nadministration, and regulatory authorities worldwide, could adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations.\\nConsolidation and integration of private payors and pharmacy benefit managers in the U.S. has also significantly impacted the market for\\npharmaceuticals by increasing payor leverage in negotiating manufacturer price or rebate concessions and pharmacy reimbursement rates. Furthermore,\\nrestrictive or unfavorable pricing, coverage, or reimbursement determinations for our medicines or product candidates by governments, regulatory\\nagencies, courts, or private payers, such as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\\' national coverage determination for monoclonal antibodies for\\nthe treatment of Alzheimer\\'s Disease, may adversely impact our business and consolidated results of operations. We expect that these actions may\\nintensify and could particularly affect certain products, such as insulin, as governments manage and emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, which could\\nadversely affect our business. In addition, we are engaged in litigation and investigations related to our 340B program and access to insulin that, if\\nresolved adversely to us, could negatively impact our business and consolidated results of operations. It is not currently possible to predict the overall\\npotential adverse impact to us or the general pharmaceutical industry of continued cost containment efforts worldwide.\\nIn addition, regulatory issues concerning compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, quality assurance, evolving standards, and increased\\nscrutiny around excipients and potential impurities such as nitrosamines, and similar regulations and standards (and comparable foreign regulations and\\nstandards) for our products can lead to regulatory and legal actions, product recalls and seizures, fines and penalties, interruption of production leading to\\nproduct shortages, import bans or denials of import certifications, delays or denials in new product approvals or line extensions or supplemental\\napprovals of current products pending resolution of the issues, and reputational harm, any of which would adversely affect our business. Moreover,\\nincreased focus on business combinations across industries and jurisdictions can lead to impediments to the completion of business combinations.\\nSee Item 1, \"Business—Regulations and Private Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access\" and Note 16 to the\\nconsolidated financial statements for additional information.\\nProduct Supply\\nWe have faced challenges, and expect to continue to face challenges, meeting strong demand for our incretin products, including due to the limited and\\nfluctuating availability of competitor therapies. In the U.S., given very strong uptake of Mounjaro following its launch in the U.S. for type 2 diabetes in the\\nsecond quarter of 2022, and as demand for Trulicity  has remained strong, we have experienced intermittent delays in fulfilling certain U.S. orders for\\nthese products. Outside the U.S., we have implemented certain actions to minimize the impact on existing Trulicity patients, but we expect to continue to\\nexperience intermittent disruptions in our supply of Trulicity in international markets.\\nWe anticipate tight supplies of our incretin products will persist until additional manufacturing capacity is operationalized. We expect additional internal and\\ncontracted manufacturing capacity will become fully operational around the world in the next several years, with significant expansion in 2023, as part of\\nour ongoing efforts to meet the significant demand for our incretin medicines.\\nTax Matters\\nWe are subject to income taxes and various other taxes in the U.S. and in many foreign jurisdictions; therefore, changes in both domestic and\\ninternational tax laws or regulations have affected and may affect our effective tax rate, results of operations, and cash flows. In 2017, the U.S. enacted\\nthe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act), which contained a provision that requires capitalization and amortization of research and development\\nexpenses for tax purposes starting in 2022. Previously, these expenses could be deducted in the year incurred. The implementation of this provision\\nincreased our cash payments of income taxes by approximately $1.20 billion in 2022. While the implementation of this provision will continue to increase\\nour cash payments of income taxes, the increase will moderately decrease from 2022 levels over the five-year amortization period.\\n®\\n43\\n', 'The U.S. and countries around the world are actively proposing and enacting tax law changes. Further, actions taken with respect to tax-related matters\\nby associations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Commission could influence tax laws in\\ncountries in which we operate. Tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we do business routinely examine our tax returns and are\\nintensifying their scrutiny and examinations of profit allocations among jurisdictions. Changes to existing U.S. and foreign tax laws and increased scrutiny\\nby tax authorities in the U.S. and other jurisdictions could adversely impact our future consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates and Other Impacts\\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro,\\nJapanese yen, and Chinese yuan. While we seek to manage a portion of these exposures through hedging and other risk management techniques,\\nsignificant fluctuations in currency rates can have a material impact, either positive or negative, on our consolidated results of operations in any given\\nperiod. During the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue was unfavorably impacted by 3 percent due to foreign exchange rates. While there is\\nuncertainty in the future movements in foreign exchange rates, fluctuations in these rates have, and we currently expect in the near-term future will,\\nadversely impact our consolidated results of operations and cash flows.\\nIn addition, cost inflation, the strain on global transportation, logistics, and labor markets (including as exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the\\nemergence or escalation of, and responses to, war or unrest, including the Russia-Ukraine war), global economic downturns or uncertainty, and an\\nincrease in overall demand in our industry for certain products and materials have had, and may continue to have, a number of impacts on our business,\\nincluding increased costs and disruptions in the supply of our medicines.\\nAcquisitions\\nWe invest in external research and technologies that we believe complement and strengthen our own efforts. These investments can take many forms,\\nincluding acquisitions, collaborations, investments, and licensing arrangements. We view our business development activity as a way to enhance our\\npipeline and strengthen our business.\\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our recent acquisitions.\\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, we remain focused on protecting the health, safety, and well-being of our employees; supporting the medical system\\nand our communities; and affordability of and access to our medicines. At the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we also focused on researching,\\ndeveloping, and supplying COVID-19 therapies, although we do not currently expect significant further revenue attributable to treatments for COVID-19.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business and operations across markets to varying and\\nfluctuating degrees, including as a result of cost inflation and strain on the global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, fewer in-person\\ninteractions among patients and healthcare providers and our employees with healthcare professionals in certain markets, pricing pressures, rebates,\\nclawbacks, and other changes in reimbursement policies resulting from the financial strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on government-funded healthcare\\nsystems, and risks related to our COVID-19 therapies. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect us will depend on\\ndevelopments that are highly uncertain and beyond our knowledge or control.

We believe that amounts accessible through\\nexisting commercial paper markets should be adequate to fund short-term borrowing needs.\\nDividends of $3.92 per share and $3.40 per share were paid in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The quarterly dividend was increased to $1.13 per share\\neffective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in an indicated annual rate for 2023 of $4.52 per share.\\nCapital expenditures were $1.85 billion during 2022, compared to $1.31 billion in 2021.\\nIn 2022, we repurchased $1.50 billion of shares under our $5.00 billion share repurchase program authorized in May 2021. As of December 31, 2022, we\\nhad $3.25 billion remaining under this program. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\\nSee \"—Executive Overview—Other Matters—Patent Matters\" for information regarding recent losses of patent protection.\\nBoth domestically and abroad, we continue to monitor the potential impacts of the economic environment; the creditworthiness of our wholesalers and\\nother customers, including foreign government-backed agencies and suppliers; the uncertain impact of healthcare legislation; and various international\\ngovernment funding levels.\\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, currency values, and fair values of equity securities. These\\nfluctuations impact the costs of financing, investing, and operating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk\\nmanagement that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The objective of this risk management program is to limit the impact on earnings of\\nfluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates. All derivative activities are for purposes other than trading.\\nOur primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest rate exposures, we\\nstrive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that\\nbalance. As of December 31, 2022, substantially all of our total long-term debt carries interest at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 10\\npercent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate swaps. Based on our overall interest rate exposure at\\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, including derivatives and other interest rate risk-sensitive instruments, a hypothetical 10 percent change in interest rates\\napplied to the fair value of the instruments as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, would not have a material impact on earnings, cash flows, or\\nfair values of interest rate risk-sensitive instruments over a one-year period.\\nOur foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates, primarily the U.S. dollar against the euro, Japanese yen, and\\nChinese yuan. We face foreign currency exchange exposures when we enter into transactions arising from subsidiary trade and loan payables and\\nreceivables denominated in foreign currencies. We also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the U.S.\\ndollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period. We may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contracts to\\nreduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (primarily the euro, the Japanese yen, and Chinese yuan). Our corporate risk-management policy\\noutlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures. Gains and losses on these derivative contracts offset, in part, the impact of\\ncurrency fluctuations on the existing assets and liabilities. We periodically analyze the fair values of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts\\nto determine their sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 percent change in exchange rates (primarily against the U.S. dollar)\\napplied to the fair values of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, would not have a material impact on\\nearnings, cash flows, or financial position over a one-year period. This sensitivity analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in\\nexchange rates would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transactions.\\nOur fair value risk exposure relates primarily to our public equity investments and to equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values.\\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our carrying values of these investments were $1.16 billion and $1.83 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20 percent\\nchange in fair value of the equity instruments would have impacted other-net, (income) expense by $232.4 million and $365.6 million as of December 31,\\n2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n50\\n', 'We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our\\nfinancial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We\\nacquire and collaborate on potential products still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often\\nrequire milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in\\ndevelopment. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the\\npharmaceutical product (e.g., approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sales levels). If required by\\nthe arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing\\nis obtained.\\nIndividually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. However, if milestones for multiple products covered by\\nthese arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our\\nresults of operations or cash flows, respectively, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These\\narrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product, which would allow us to avoid making the contingent\\npayments; however, we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objectives. We view these payments as\\npositive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows\\nfrom sales of products.\\nAs we expand our manufacturing capacity in order to meet existing and expected demand of our incretin products, we have entered, and expect to\\ncontinue to enter, into various agreements for contract manufacturing and for supply of materials. The executed agreements could, under certain\\ncircumstances, require us to pay up to approximately $4.5 billion if we do not purchase specified amounts of goods or services over the durations of the\\nagreements, which generally range from 2 to 8 years.\\n51\\n', 'APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and\\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be\\nsubjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any given individual estimate or assumption we make, it is\\npossible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates. We believe that, given\\ncurrent facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our\\nconsolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this report. Our most critical accounting estimates have been\\ndiscussed with our audit committee and are described below.\\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\\nBackground and Uncertainties\\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other\\narrangements. For product sales to customers, provisions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales\\nare recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate\\nany rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts.\\nSignificant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with\\nsales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance\\nprograms, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient\\nassistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and\\nproduct launches), an evaluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our\\nproduct pricing.\\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on revenue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements will include our share of profits from the collaboration, as well as royalties, upfront and\\nmilestone payments we receive under these types of contracts.\\nFinancial Statement Impact\\nWe believe that our accruals for sales returns, rebates, and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. Our\\nrebate and discount liabilities are included in sales rebates and discounts on our consolidated balance sheet. Our sales return liability is included in other\\ncurrent liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in our consolidated\\nsales return, rebate, and discount liability would result in a change in revenue of approximately $464 million.\\nThe portion of our consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability resulting from sales of our products in the U.S. was approximately 90 percent as\\nof December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\nThe following represents a roll-forward of our most significant U.S. sales return, rebate, and discount liability balances, including managed care,\\nMedicare, Medicaid, chargeback, and patient assistance programs:\\n(Dollars in millions)\\n2022\\n2021\\nSales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, beginning of year\\n$\\n6,161.6 \\n$\\n5,400.0 \\nReduction of net sales\\n28,398.4 \\n20,106.3 \\nCash payments\\n(26,345.9)\\n(19,344.7)\\nSales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, end of year\\n$\\n8,214.1 \\n$\\n6,161.6 \\nAdjustments of the estimates for these returns, rebates, and discounts to actual results were less than 1 percent of consolidated revenue for each of the years presented.\\nIncrease in reduction of net sales in 2022 was primarily driven by our incretin products due to increase in our patient assistance programs and in volume\\nof rebates for managed care, Medicare and Medicaid programs.\\n(1)\\n(1) \\n52\\n', 'Litigation Liabilities and Other Contingencies\\nBackground and Uncertainties\\nLitigation liabilities and other contingencies are, by their nature, uncertain and based upon complex judgments and probabilities. The factors we consider\\nin developing our litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation, the nature and the\\nnumber of other similar current and past matters, the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation, as\\napplicable, and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions, if any. In addition, we accrue for certain liability claims incurred,\\nbut not filed, to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding\\nproduct usage.\\nWe also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance. In assessing our insurance coverage, we\\nconsider the policy coverage limits and exclusions, the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company, the financial condition of the insurers,\\nand the possibility of and length of time for collection. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation\\nliability losses for all our currently marketed products. In addition to insurance coverage, we consider any third-party indemnification to which we are\\nentitled or under which we are obligated. With respect to our third-party indemnification rights, these considerations include the nature of the\\nindemnification, the financial condition of the indemnifying party, and the possibility of and length of time for collection.\\nThe litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities\\nand assets, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\\nAcquisitions\\nBackground and Uncertainties\\nTo determine whether acquisitions or licensing transactions should be accounted for as a business combination or as an asset acquisition, we make\\ncertain judgments, which include assessing whether the acquired set of activities and assets would meet the definition of a business under the relevant\\naccounting rules.\\nIf the acquired set of activities and assets meets the definition of a business, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are required to be recorded at their\\nrespective fair values on our consolidated balance sheet as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired\\nnet assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. If the acquired set of activities and assets does not meet the definition of a business, the\\ntransaction is recorded as an acquisition of assets and, therefore, any acquired IPR&D that does not have an alternative future use is charged to\\nacquired IPR&D and development milestones on our consolidated statement of operations at the acquisition date, and goodwill is not recorded. See Note\\n3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\\nThe judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as\\nestimated asset lives, can materially affect our consolidated results of operations. The fair values of intangible assets, including acquired IPR&D, are\\ndetermined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management.\\nSignificant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, probability of technical success, revenue projections, and discount rate. Depending\\non the facts and circumstances, we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant assets and\\nliabilities.\\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets are primarily determined using an \"income method,\" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nThe fair value of any contingent consideration liability that results from a business combination is primarily determined using a discounted cash flow\\nanalysis, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of\\nsignificant estimates and judgments, including, but not limited to, probability of technical success and the discount rate.\\nFinancial Statement Impact\\nAs of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the contingent consideration liabilities would result in a change in income before income taxes of $5.5\\nmillion.\\n53\\n', 'Impairment of Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets\\nBackground and Uncertainties\\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets (both intangible and tangible) for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or\\nchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We identify impairment by comparing the\\nprojected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (or asset group) to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded\\nequal to the excess of the asset\\'s net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.\\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, by\\nfirst assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount.\\nIf we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying amount, a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the\\nintangible asset to its carrying value is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.\\nSeveral methods may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired IPR&D, all of which require multiple assumptions. We utilize the \"income\\nmethod,\" as described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\\nFor acquired IPR&D assets, the risk of failure has been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these assets ultimately will\\nyield a successful product, as discussed previously in \"—Executive Overview—Late-Stage Pipeline.\" The nature of the pharmaceutical business is high-\\nrisk and requires that we invest in a large number of projects to maintain a successful portfolio of approved products. As such, it is likely that some\\nacquired IPR&D assets will become impaired in the future.\\nEstimates of future cash flows, based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections, require management\\'s\\njudgment. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates.\\nRetirement Benefits Assumptions\\nBackground and Uncertainties\\nDefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, and\\nretirement age. These assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. In addition to the analysis below, see Note 15 to the consolidated\\nfinancial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits.\\nAnnually, we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. We use an\\nactuarially determined, plan-specific yield curve of high quality, fixed income debt instruments to determine the discount rates. In evaluating the expected\\nreturn on plan assets, we consider many factors, with a primary analysis of current and projected market conditions, asset returns and asset allocations\\n(approximately 70 percent of which are growth investments), and the views of leading financial advisers and economists. We may also review our\\nhistorical assumptions compared with actual results, as well as the discount rates and expected return on plan assets of other companies, where\\napplicable. In evaluating our expected retirement age assumption, we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and\\nmedical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages.\\nAnnually, we determine the fair value of the plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 50 percent of our\\nplan assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (collectively, alternative assets). We value these alternative investments using\\nsignificant unobservable inputs or using the net asset value reported by the counterparty, adjusted as necessary. Inputs include underlying net asset\\nvalues, discounted cash flows valuations, comparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks.\\n54\\n', 'Financial Statement Impact\\nIf the 2022 discount rate for the U.S. defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans (U.S. plans) were to change by a quarter percentage point,\\nincome before income taxes would change by $23.8 million. If the 2022 expected return on plan assets for U.S. plans were to change by a quarter\\npercentage point, income before income taxes would change by $33.5 million. If our assumption regarding the 2022 expected age of future retirees for\\nU.S. plans were adjusted by one year, our income before income taxes would be affected by $46.3 million. The U.S. plans, including Puerto Rico,\\nrepresent approximately 85 percent of each of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan assets at December 31, 2022.\\nAdjustments to the fair value of plan assets are not recognized in pension and retiree health benefit expense in the year that the adjustments occur. Such\\nchanges are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into expense over the expected remaining service life of\\nemployees.\\nIncome Taxes\\nBackground and Uncertainties\\nWe file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations, and we record estimates in our financial statements based upon these\\ninterpretations at the applicable tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our tax returns are routinely subject to examination by taxing\\nauthorities, which could result in future tax, interest, and penalty assessments. Inherent uncertainties also exist in estimates of many tax positions due to\\nthe complexity of tax laws. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be\\nsustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial\\nstatements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate\\nresolution. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances such as changes to existing tax law, the\\nissuance of regulations by taxing authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination, or resolution of a tax examination. We believe our\\nestimates for uncertain tax positions are both appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We\\nrecognize both accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\\nWe have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets, primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses,\\ntax credits, and other tax carryforwards and carrybacks in certain taxing jurisdictions. In evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these\\ndeferred tax assets, we have not assumed future taxable income in the jurisdictions associated with these carryforwards where history does not support\\nsuch an assumption. Implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or to generate future taxable income in these\\njurisdictions could lead to the reversal of all or a portion of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense.\\nFinancial Statement Impact\\nAs of December 31, 2022, a 5 percent change in the amount of uncertain tax positions and the valuation allowance would result in a change in net\\nincome of $85.0 million and $38.8 million, respectively.\\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\\nInformation relating to certain legal proceedings can be found in Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated here by reference.\\nItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\nYou can find quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk (e.g. , interest rate risk) at Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis -\\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity.\" That information is incorporated by reference herein.\\n55\\n', 'Item 8.

except per-share data)\\nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include Eli Lilly and Company and all subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with\\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We consider majority voting interests, as well as effective economic or other\\ncontrol over an entity when deciding whether or not to consolidate an entity. We generally do not have control by means other than voting interests.\\nWhere our ownership of consolidated subsidiaries is less than 100 percent, the noncontrolling shareholders' interests are reflected as a separate\\ncomponent of equity. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period. Actual\\nresults could differ from those estimates. We issued our financial statements by filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and have\\nevaluated subsequent events up to the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to conform with the current\\npresentation.\\nWe operate as a single operating segment engaged in the discovery, development, manufacturing, marketing, and sales of pharmaceutical products\\nworldwide. A global research and development organization and a supply chain organization are responsible for the discovery, development,\\nmanufacturing, and supply of our products. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute, and sell the products. The business is also supported\\nby global corporate staff functions. Our determination that we operate as a single segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed\\nby the chief operating decision maker for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning\\nand forecasting for future periods.\\nResearch and Development Expenses and Acquired In-Process Research and Development (IPR&D) and Development Milestones\\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in performing research and\\ndevelopment activities, including but not limited to, compensation and benefits, facilities and overhead expense, clinical trial expense and fees paid to\\ncontract research organizations.\\nAcquired IPR&D and development milestones include the initial costs of externally developed IPR&D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other\\nthan a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use. Additionally, milestone payment obligations related to these transactions that are\\nincurred prior to regulatory approval of the compound are expensed when the event triggering an obligation to pay the milestone occurs.\\nEarnings Per Share (EPS)\\nAll per-share amounts, unless otherwise noted in the footnotes, are presented on a diluted basis. We calculate basic EPS based on the weighted-\\naverage number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from potential participating securities. We calculate diluted EPS\\nbased on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus the effect of incremental shares from our stock-based compensation\\nprograms.\\n61\\n\", 'Foreign Currency Translation\\nOperations in our subsidiaries outside the United States (U.S.) are recorded in the functional currency of each subsidiary which is determined by a review\\nof the environment where each subsidiary primarily generates and expends cash. The results of operations for our subsidiaries outside the U.S. are\\ntranslated from functional currencies into U.S. dollars using the weighted average currency rate for the period. Assets and liabilities are translated using\\nthe period end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries are recorded in other\\ncomprehensive income (loss).\\nAdvertising Expenses\\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in marketing, selling, and administrative expenses.  Advertising expenses,\\ncomprised primarily of television, radio, print media, and internet advertising, totaled approximately $1.0 billion, $1.2 billion, and $1.1 billion in 2022, 2021,\\nand 2020, respectively, which was less than 5 percent of revenue each year.\\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\\nOur other significant accounting policies are described in the remaining appropriate notes to the consolidated financial statements.\\nImplementation of New Financial Accounting Standards\\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) 2021-10, Government Assistance, establishes annual disclosure requirements for companies that analogize to a\\ngrant or contribution accounting model for government assistance transactions. We adopted the standard as of January 1, 2022. The adoption did not\\nimpact our financial statement disclosures.\\nASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform, as further modified by ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06, provides for temporary optional expedients and\\nexceptions in applying current GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition from the use of the London\\nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to an alternative reference rate. The standard is currently applicable to contracts entered into before January 1, 2025. We\\nadopted the standard in the first quarter of 2022. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\\nNote 2: Revenue\\nThe following table summarizes our revenue recognized in our consolidated statements of operations:\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nNet product revenue\\n$\\n25,462.8 \\n$\\n25,957.9 \\n$\\n22,694.8 \\nCollaboration and other revenue\\n3,078.6 \\n2,360.5 \\n1,845.0 \\nRevenue\\n$\\n28,541.4 \\n$\\n28,318.4 \\n$\\n24,539.8 \\nCollaboration and other revenue associated with prior period transfers of intellectual property was $163.4 million, $175.0 million, and $135.6 million during the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product revenue) and collaborations and other\\narrangements. Revenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties,\\nupfront and milestone payments we receive under these types of contracts. See Note 4 for additional information related to our collaborations and other\\narrangements. Collaboration and other revenue disclosed above includes the revenue from the Jardiance and Trajenta  families of products resulting\\nfrom our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim discussed in Note 4. Substantially all of the remainder of collaboration and other revenue is related to\\ncontracts accounted for as contracts with customers.\\n(1)\\n(1) \\n® \\n \\n®\\n62\\n', 'Net Product Revenue\\nRevenue from sales of products is recognized at the point where the customer obtains control of the goods and we satisfy our performance obligation,\\nwhich generally is at the time we ship the product to the customer. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment terms in most of our\\nmajor jurisdictions typically range from 30 to 70 days from date of shipment. Revenue for our product sales has not been adjusted for the effects of a\\nfinancing component as we expect, at contract inception, that the period between when we transfer control of the product and when we receive payment\\nwill be one year or less. Any exceptions are either not material or we collect interest for payments made after the due date. Provisions for rebates,\\ndiscounts, and returns are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. We generally ship product shortly after orders are\\nreceived; therefore, we generally only have a few days of orders received but not yet shipped at the end of any reporting period. Shipping and handling\\nactivities are considered to be fulfillment activities and are not considered to be a separate performance obligation. We exclude from the measurement of\\nthe transaction price all taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on our sales of product and collected from a customer.\\nMost of our products are sold to wholesalers that serve pharmacies, physicians and other healthcare professionals, and hospitals. For the years ended\\nDecember 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, our three largest wholesalers each accounted for between 16 percent and 21 percent of consolidated revenue.\\nFurther, they each accounted for between 18 percent and 29 percent of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of products related to anticipated rebates, discounts, and returns.\\nThe following describe the most significant of these judgments:\\nSales Rebates and Discounts - Background and Uncertainties\\n•\\nWe initially invoice our customers at contractual list prices. Contracts with direct and indirect customers may provide for various rebates and\\ndiscounts that may differ in each contract. As a consequence, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we\\nrecognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers\\nin the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates.\\n•\\nThe rebate and discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Sales rebates and discounts that require the\\nuse of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, chargebacks, long-term care, hospital, patient\\nassistance programs, and various other programs. We estimate these accruals using an expected value approach.\\n•\\nThe largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales covered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and\\nchargeback programs, as well as reductions in revenue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate\\naccrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a\\npercentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an evaluation of\\nthe current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold via these programs, and our product pricing. Although we\\naccrue a liability for revenue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid\\nup to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product revenue may incorporate revisions of accruals for several\\nperiods.\\n•\\nMost of our rebates outside the U.S. are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the\\nrelated sales. In some large European countries, government rebates are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payments in the\\ncountry. An estimate of these rebates, updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits, is recognized in the same period as the\\nrelated sale.\\n63\\n', \"Sales Returns - Background and Uncertainties\\n•\\nWhen product sales occur, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sales, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to\\nthose sales using an expected value approach. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by\\nproduct (on average, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the\\nwholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent\\nexclusivity, product recalls and discontinuations, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S.\\ncustomers to return most of our products for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date.\\nFollowing the loss of exclusivity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product\\ninventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be\\nrequired based on revised estimates to our assumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Once\\nthe product is returned, it is destroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictive\\nthan in the U.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserve for future\\nproduct returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\\n•\\nAs a part of our process to estimate a reserve for product returns, we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products at the major\\nwholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major\\nwholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler\\ninventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual\\nwholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation\\nnetwork, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements\\nprovides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers; however, our data on inventory levels in the retail channel is more limited.\\nWholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.\\n•\\nActual U.S. product returns have been less than 2 percent of our U.S. revenue during each of the past three years and have not fluctuated\\nsignificantly as a percentage of revenue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusivity for major products in\\nthe U.S. market.\\nAdjustments to Revenue\\nAdjustments to increase revenue, recognized as a result of changes in estimates for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates, and discounts\\nliability balances for products shipped in previous periods, were less than 1 percent of U.S. revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2022,\\n2021, and 2020.\\nCollaboration and Other Arrangements\\nWe recognize several types of revenue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more\\nspecifically in Note 4 for each of our material collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are not contracts with\\ncustomers but are evaluated to determine whether any aspects of the arrangements are contracts with customers.\\n•\\nRevenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product revenue, while other sources of revenue (e.g.,\\nroyalties and profit sharing from our partner) are included in collaboration and other revenue.\\n•\\nProfit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as\\ncollaboration and other revenue as earned.\\n•\\nRoyalty revenue from licensees and certain of our collaboration partners, which is based on sales to third-parties of licensed products and\\ntechnology, is recorded when the third-party sale occurs and the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated\\nhas been satisfied (or partially satisfied). This royalty revenue is included in collaboration and other revenue.\\n64\\n\", \"•\\nFor arrangements involving multiple goods or services (e.g., research and development, marketing and selling, manufacturing, and distribution),\\neach required good or service is evaluated to determine whether it is distinct. If a good or service does not qualify as distinct, it is combined with\\nthe other non-distinct goods or services within the arrangement and these combined goods or services are treated as a single performance\\nobligation for accounting purposes. The arrangement's transaction price is then allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative\\nstandalone selling price of each performance obligation. For arrangements that involve variable consideration where we have sold intellectual\\nproperty, we recognize revenue based on estimates of the amount of consideration we believe we will be entitled to receive from the other party,\\nsubject to a constraint. These estimates are adjusted to reflect the actual amounts to be collected when those facts and circumstances become\\nknown.\\n•\\nSignificant judgments must be made in determining the transaction price for our sales of intellectual property. Because of the risk that products in\\ndevelopment will not receive regulatory approval, we generally do not recognize any contingent payments that would be due to us upon or after\\nregulatory approval.\\nContract Liabilities\\nOur contract liabilities result from arrangements where we have received payment in advance of performance under the contract and do not include\\nsales returns, rebates, and discounts. Changes in contract liabilities are generally due to either receipt of additional advance payments or our\\nperformance under the contract.\\nThe following table summarizes contract liability balances:\\n \\n2022\\n2021\\nContract liabilities\\n$\\n219.2 \\n$\\n262.6 \\nThe contract liabilities balances disclosed above as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were primarily related to the remaining license period of symbolic\\nintellectual property and obligations to perform research and development activities or supply product for a defined period of time.\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, revenue recognized from contract liabilities as of the beginning of the respective year was\\nnot material.

(Akouos), Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail), and\\nDermira, Inc. (Dermira), respectively. These transactions, as further discussed below in Acquisitions of Businesses, were accounted for as business\\ncombinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their\\nrespective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value required management\\nto make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has\\nbeen recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of\\nacquisition.\\nWe also acquired assets in development in 2022, 2021, and 2020, which are further discussed below in Asset Acquisitions. Upon each acquisition, the\\ncost allocated to acquired IPR&D was immediately expensed if the compound has no alternative future use. Milestone payment obligations incurred prior\\nto regulatory approval of the compound are expensed when the event triggering an obligation to pay the milestone occurs. We recognized acquired\\nIPR&D and development milestone charges of $908.5 million, $970.1 million, and $769.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and\\n2020, respectively.\\nAcquisitions of Businesses\\nAkouos Acquisition\\nOverview of Transaction\\nIn December 2022, we acquired all shares of Akouos for a purchase price that included $ 12.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $327.2 million, net\\nof cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles the Akouos shareholders up to an additional $ 3.00 per\\nshare in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $122 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the achievement of certain specified\\nmilestones.\\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potential gene therapy treatments for hearing loss and other inner ear conditions. The lead gene\\ntherapies in clinical development that we acquired included GJB2 (which encodes connexin 26) for a common form of monogenic deafness and hearing\\nloss; AK-OTOF for hearing loss due to mutations in the otoferlin gene; AK-CLRN1 for Usher Type 3A, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by\\nprogressive loss of both hearing and vision; and AK-antiVEGF for vestibular schwannoma.\\n(1)\\n(1) \\n67\\n', \"Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\\nOur access to Akouos information was limited prior to the acquisition. As a consequence, we are in the process of determining fair values and tax bases\\nof a significant portion of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including the identification and valuation of intangible assets and tax exposures. The\\nfinal determination of these amounts will be completed as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date. The final determination\\nmay result in asset and liability fair values and tax bases that differ from the preliminary estimates and require changes to the preliminary amounts\\nrecognized.\\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date:\\nEstimated Fair Value at December 1, 2022\\nCash\\n$\\n153.2 \\nAcquired IPR&D\\n184.0\\nGoodwill\\n181.2\\nOther assets and liabilities, net\\n28.9 \\nAcquisition date fair value of consideration transferred\\n547.3\\nLess:\\nCash acquired\\n(153.2)\\nFair value of CVR liability\\n(66.9)\\nCash paid, net of cash acquired\\n$\\n327.2 \\nAcquired IPR&D intangibles primarily relate to GJB2.\\nThe goodwill recognized from this acquisition is attributable primarily to future unidentified projects and products and the assembled workforce for Akouos and is not deductible for\\ntax purposes.\\nSee Note 7 for a discussion on the estimation of the CVR liability.\\nThe results of operations attributable to Akouos for the year ended December 31, 2022 were immaterial.\\nPro forma information has not been included as this acquisition did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the years\\nended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\\nPrevail Acquisition\\nOverview of Transaction\\nIn January 2021, we acquired all shares of Prevail for a purchase price that included $ 22.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $747.4 million, net of\\ncash acquired) plus one non-tradable CVR per share. The CVR entitles Prevail stockholders up to an additional $ 4.00 per share in cash (or an aggregate\\nof approximately $160 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the first regulatory approval of a Prevail product in one of the\\nfollowing countries: U.S., Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy or Spain. To achieve the full value of the CVR, such regulatory approval must\\noccur by December 31, 2024. If such regulatory approval occurs after December 31, 2024, the value of the CVR will be reduced by approximately 8.3\\ncents per month until December 1, 2028, at which point the CVR will expire without payment.\\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potentially disease-modifying AAV9-based gene therapies for patients with neurodegenerative diseases.\\nThe acquisition established a new modality for drug discovery and development, extending our research efforts through the creation of a gene therapy\\nprogram that is being anchored by Prevail's portfolio of assets. The lead gene therapies in clinical development that we acquired were PR001 for patients\\nwith Parkinson's disease with GBA1 mutations and neuronopathic Gaucher disease and PR006 for patients with frontotemporal dementia with GRN\\nmutations.

Under terms of the\\nagreement, we acquired lebrikizumab, a novel, investigational, monoclonal antibody being evaluated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic\\ndermatitis. We also acquired Qbrexza  (glycopyrronium) cloth, a medicated cloth approved by the FDA for the topical treatment of primary axillary\\nhyperhidrosis (uncontrolled excessive underarm sweating). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold the rights to Qbrexza.

As part of our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the request of the U.S. and international\\ngovernments, we invested in large-scale manufacturing of COVID-19 antibodies at risk, in order to ensure rapid access to patients around the world. As\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic evolved during 2021, we incurred a net inventory impairment charge primarily due to the combination of changes to demand\\nfrom U.S. and international governments, including changes to our agreement with the U.S. government, and near-term expiry dates of COVID-19\\nantibodies.\\nNote 7: Financial Instruments\\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\\nOur equity investments are accounted for using three different methods depending on the type of equity investment:\\n•\\nInvestments in companies over which we have significant influence but not a controlling interest are accounted for using the equity method, with\\nour share of earnings or losses reported in other-net, (income) expense.\\n•\\nFor equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, we measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, plus or\\nminus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Any\\nchange in recorded value is recorded in other-net, (income) expense.\\n•\\nOur public equity investments are measured and carried at fair value. Any change in fair value is recognized in other-net, (income) expense.\\nWe adjust our equity investments without readily determinable fair values based upon changes in the equity instruments' values resulting from observable\\nprice changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Downward adjustments resulting from an impairment are\\nrecorded based upon impairment considerations, including the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, general market conditions, and\\nindustry specific factors. Adjustments recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material.\\nThe net gains (losses) recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for equity securities were $( 410.7) million, $176.9 million, and $1.44 billion\\nfor the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

We periodically assess our investment in available-for-sale securities for impairment losses and credit losses. The amount of credit losses\\nare determined by comparing the difference between the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected on these securities and the\\namortized cost. Factors considered in assessing credit losses include the position in the capital structure, vintage and amount of collateral, delinquency\\nrates, current credit support, and geographic concentration.

Wholesale\\ndistributors of life science products account for a substantial portion of our trade receivables; collateral is generally not required. We seek to mitigate the\\nrisk associated with this concentration through our ongoing credit-review procedures and insurance. A large portion of our cash is held by a few major\\nfinancial institutions. We monitor our exposures with these institutions and do not expect any of these institutions to fail to meet their obligations. In\\naccordance with documented corporate risk-management policies, we monitor the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution or corporate\\nissuer. We are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to risk-management instruments but do not expect any\\ncounterparties to fail to meet their obligations given their investment grade credit ratings.\\nWe have entered into accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions to sell certain of our non-U.S. accounts receivable. These\\ntransactions are accounted for as sales and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over and risk\\nrelated to the receivables to the buyers. Our factoring agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility, and we do not retain any\\ninterest in the underlying accounts receivable once sold. We derecognized $422.1 million and $550.5 million of accounts receivable as of December 31,\\n2022 and 2021, respectively, under these factoring arrangements. The costs of factoring such accounts receivable on our consolidated results of\\noperations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material.\\nOur derivative activities are initiated within the guidelines of documented corporate risk-management policies and are intended to offset losses and gains\\non the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. Management reviews the correlation and effectiveness of our derivatives on a quarterly basis.\\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the derivative instrument is marked to market, with gains and losses\\nrecognized currently in income to offset the respective losses and gains recognized on the underlying exposure. For derivative instruments that are\\ndesignated and qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note\\n17) and reclassified into earnings in the same period the hedged transaction affects earnings. For derivative and non-derivative instruments that are\\ndesignated and qualify as net investment hedges, the foreign currency translation gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations are reported as a\\ncomponent of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17). Derivative contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments are\\nrecorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in earnings during the period of change.\\n77\\n\", 'We may enter into foreign currency forward or option contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rates (principally the euro, British\\npound, Chinese yuan, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc). Foreign currency derivatives used for hedging are put in place using the same or like currencies\\nand duration as the underlying exposures. Forward and option contracts are principally used to manage exposures arising from subsidiary trade and loan\\npayables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are recorded at fair value with the gain or loss recognized in other–net,\\n(income) expense. We may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts and currency swaps as fair value hedges of firm commitments.\\nForward contracts generally have maturities not exceeding 12 months. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency forward\\ncommitments as follows, all of which have settlement dates within 180 days:\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nPurchase\\nSell\\nCurrency\\nAmount\\n(in millions)\\nCurrency\\nAmount\\n(in millions)\\nU.S. dollars\\n2,516.2\\nEuro\\n2,369.2\\nEuro\\n3,371.1\\nU.S. dollars\\n3,575.3\\nU.S. dollars\\n199.8\\nChinese yuan\\n1,396.2\\nJapanese yen\\n14,139.9\\nU.S. dollars\\n105.3\\nU.S. dollars\\n90.9\\nJapanese yen\\n12,212.2\\nBritish pounds\\n207.1\\nU.S. dollars\\n254.7\\nSwiss franc\\n101.4\\nU.S. dollars\\n109.3\\nForeign currency exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and foreign currency\\nforward contracts. Our foreign currency-denominated notes had carrying amounts of $6.83 billion and $7.90 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively, of which $5.45 billion and $5.79 billion have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of net investments in certain of our\\nforeign operations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, we had outstanding cross currency swaps with notional\\namounts of $1.02 billion swapping U.S. dollars to euro and $ 1.00 billion swapping Swiss francs to U.S. dollars which have settlement dates ranging\\nthrough 2028. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps, for which a majority convert a portion of our U.S. dollar-denominated fixed-rate debt to foreign-\\ndenominated fixed rate debt, have also been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of net investments. At December 31, 2022, we had\\noutstanding foreign currency forward contracts to sell 325.0 million euro and to sell 1.82 billion Chinese yuan, with settlement dates ranging through 2023,\\nwhich have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of net investments.\\nIn the normal course of business, our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates which can vary the costs of financing, investing, and\\noperating. We seek to address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial\\ninstruments. The objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on earnings. Our primary interest-rate risk\\nexposure results from changes in short-term U.S. dollar interest rates. In an effort to manage interest-rate exposures, we strive to achieve an acceptable\\nbalance between fixed- and floating-rate debt and investment positions and may enter into interest rate swaps or collars to help maintain that balance.\\nInterest rate swaps or collars that convert our fixed-rate debt to a floating rate are designated as fair value hedges of the underlying instruments. Interest\\nrate swaps or collars that convert floating-rate debt to a fixed rate are designated as cash flow hedges. Interest expense on the debt is adjusted to include\\nthe payments made or received under the swap agreements. Cash proceeds from or payments to counterparties resulting from the termination of interest\\nrate swaps are classified as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. At December 31, 2022, substantially all of our total long-\\nterm debt is at a fixed rate. We have converted approximately 10 percent of our long-term fixed-rate notes to floating rates through the use of interest rate\\nswaps.\\n78\\n', 'We also may enter into forward-starting interest rate swaps, which we designate as cash flow hedges, as part of any anticipated future debt issuances in\\norder to reduce the risk of cash flow volatility from future changes in interest rates. The change in fair value of these instruments is recorded as part of\\nother comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 17) and, upon completion of a debt issuance and termination of the swap, is amortized to interest expense\\nover the life of the underlying debt.

Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when an indicator of impairment\\nis present. When required, a comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of assets is performed to determine the amount of any impairment.

Expenses associated with these benefit plans for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not material.\\nBenefit Plan Investments\\nOur benefit plan investment policies are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirements in relationship to the respective liabilities. U.S. and\\nPuerto Rico plans represent approximately 85 percent of our global investments. Given the long-term nature of our liabilities, these plans have the\\nflexibility to manage an above-average degree of risk in the asset portfolios. At the investment-policy level, there are no specifically prohibited\\ninvestments. However, within individual investment manager mandates, restrictions and limitations are contractually set to align with our investment\\nobjectives, ensure risk control, and limit concentrations.\\nWe manage our portfolio to minimize concentration of risk by allocating funds within asset categories. In addition, within a category we use different\\nmanagers with various management objectives to eliminate any significant concentration of risk.\\n95\\n', 'Our global benefit plans may enter into contractual arrangements (derivatives) to implement the local investment policy or manage particular portfolio\\nrisks. Derivatives are principally used to increase or decrease exposure to a particular public equity, fixed income, commodity, or currency market more\\nrapidly or less expensively than could be accomplished through the use of the cash markets. The plans utilize both exchange-traded and over-the-\\ncounter instruments. The maximum exposure to either a market or counterparty credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable, and is\\nmanaged within contractual limits. We expect all of our counterparties to meet their obligations. The gross values of these derivative receivables and\\npayables are not material to the global asset portfolio, and their values are reflected within the tables below.\\nThe defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the U.S. and Puerto Rico currently comprises approximately 75 percent growth\\ninvestments and 25 percent fixed-income investments. The growth investment allocation encompasses U.S. and international public equity securities,\\nhedge funds, private equity-like investments, and real estate. These portfolio allocations are intended to reduce overall risk by providing diversification,\\nwhile seeking moderate to high returns over the long term.\\nPublic equity securities are well diversified and invested in U.S. and international small-to-large companies across various asset managers and styles.\\nThe remaining portion of the growth portfolio is invested in private alternative investments.\\nFixed-income investments primarily consist of fixed-income securities in U.S. treasuries and agencies, emerging market debt obligations, corporate\\nbonds, bank loans, mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed obligations, and any related repurchase agreements.\\nHedge funds are privately owned institutional investment funds that generally have moderate liquidity. Hedge funds seek specified levels of absolute\\nreturn regardless of overall market conditions, and generally have low correlations to public equity and debt markets. Hedge funds often invest\\nsubstantially in financial market instruments (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, derivatives, etc.) using a very broad range of trading activities to\\nmanage portfolio risks. Hedge fund strategies focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect to market moves. Common\\ngroupings of hedge fund strategies include relative value, tactical, and event driven. Relative value strategies include arbitrage, when the same asset can\\nsimultaneously be bought and sold at different prices, achieving an immediate profit. Tactical strategies often take long and short positions to reduce or\\neliminate overall market risks while seeking a particular investment opportunity. Event strategy opportunities can evolve from specific company\\nannouncements such as mergers and acquisitions, and typically have little correlation to overall market directional movements. Our hedge fund\\ninvestments are made through limited partnership interests in fund-of-funds structures and directly into hedge funds. Plan holdings in hedge funds are\\nvalued based on net asset values (NAVs) calculated by each fund or general partner, as applicable, and we have the ability to redeem these investments\\nat NAV.\\nPrivate equity-like investment funds typically have low liquidity and are made through long-term partnerships or joint ventures that invest in pools of capital\\ninvested in primarily non-publicly traded entities. Underlying investments include venture capital (early stage investing), buyout, special situations, private\\ndebt, and private real estate investments. Private equity management firms typically acquire and then reorganize private companies to create increased\\nlong term value. Private equity-like funds usually have a limited life of approximately 10-15 years, and require a minimum investment commitment from\\ntheir limited partners. Our private equity-like investments are made both directly into funds and through fund-of-funds structures to ensure broad\\ndiversification of management styles and assets across the portfolio. Plan holdings in private equity-like investments are valued using the value reported\\nby the partnership, adjusted for known cash flows and significant events through our reporting date. Values provided by the partnerships are primarily\\nbased on analysis of and judgments about the underlying investments. Inputs to these valuations include underlying NAVs, discounted cash flow\\nvaluations, comparable market valuations, and may also include adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks as applicable. The vast majority\\nof these private partnerships provide us with annual audited financial statements including their compliance with fair valuation procedures consistent with\\napplicable accounting standards.\\nReal estate is composed of public holdings.

These\\nclaims or proceedings can involve various types of parties, including governments, competitors, customers, suppliers, service providers, licensees,\\nemployees, or shareholders, among others. These matters may involve patent infringement, antitrust, securities, pricing, sales and marketing practices,\\nenvironmental, commercial, contractual rights, licensing obligations, health and safety matters, consumer fraud, employment matters, product liability and\\ninsurance coverage, among others. The resolution of these matters often develops over a long period of time and expectations can change as a result of\\nnew findings, rulings, appeals or settlement arrangements. Legal proceedings that are significant or that we believe could become significant or material\\nare described below.\\nWe believe the legal proceedings in which we are named as defendants are without merit and we are defending against them vigorously. It is not possible\\nto determine the final outcome of these matters, and we cannot reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in\\nexcess of amounts accrued for any of these matters; however, we believe that the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on\\nour consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period.\\nLitigation accruals, environmental liabilities, and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets,\\nrespectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. With respect to the product liability claims currently asserted against us, we have accrued for our\\nestimated exposures to the extent they are both probable and reasonably estimable based on the information available to us. We accrue for certain\\nproduct liability claims incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs. We estimate these expenses based\\nprimarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant\\nproduct liability loss contingencies are accrued when both probable and reasonably estimable.\\nBecause of the nature of pharmaceutical products, it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of additional product liability and related\\nclaims in the future. Due to a very restrictive market for litigation liability insurance, we are self-insured for litigation liability losses for all our currently and\\npreviously marketed products.\\nPatent Litigation\\nAlimta European Patent Litigation\\nIn Europe, Alimta (pemetrexed) was protected by a patent through June 2021. A number of legal proceedings that were initiated prior to patent expiration\\nare ongoing.\\nEmgality Patent Litigation\\nWe are a named defendant in litigation filed by Teva Pharmaceuticals International GMBH and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA , Inc. (collectively, Teva) in the\\nU.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a ruling that various claims in three different Teva patents would be infringed by our launch\\nand continued sales of Emgality for the prevention of migraine in adults.\\nFollowing a trial, in November 2022, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Teva. The parties have filed post-trial motions on which the court will rule and\\nthen enter final judgment in the case. We intend to appeal the jury verdict if necessary. Pursuant to agreement by the parties, the award, if any, will not\\nbecome due until completion of the appeal process. This matter is ongoing.\\nIn June 2021, we were named as a defendant in a second litigation filed by Teva in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts seeking a\\nruling that two of Teva's patents, which are directed toward use of the active ingredient in Emgality to treat migraine, would be infringed by our continued\\nsales of Emgality. We challenged these two patents by filing requests for Inter Partes Review with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) and in\\nOctober 2022, the PTAB granted our requests.The corresponding district court litigation is stayed while this PTAB proceeding is ongoing.\\n99\\n\", 'Jardiance Patent Litigation\\nIn November 2018, Boehringer Ingelheim, our partner in marketing and development of Jardiance, initiated U.S. patent litigation in the U.S. District Court\\nfor the District of Delaware alleging infringement arising from submissions of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) by a number of generic\\ncompanies seeking approval to market generic versions of Jardiance, Glyxambi, and Synjardy in accordance with the procedures set out in the Drug\\nPrice Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act). Particularly with respect to Jardiance, the generic companies\\'\\nANDAs seek approval to market generic versions of Jardiance prior to the expiration of the relevant patents, and allege that certain patents, including in\\nsome allegations the compound patent, are invalid or would not be infringed. We are not a party to this litigation. This litigation has been stayed.\\nTaltz Patent Litigation\\nBeginning in May 2020, Lilly and Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) had been litigating the validity and alleged infringement by Taltz of certain patents\\nNovartis acquired from Genentech, Inc. (Genentech). As of October 2022, we had pending cases in Ireland, Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands\\nwhere Novartis sought injunctions to stop Taltz commercialization.\\nIn October 2022, we entered into a cashless (no-payment) settlement and mutual release agreement with Novartis, which resolved such disputes.\\nWithout any admission of liability or wrongdoing, we and Novartis have agreed to mutual releases for past claims and mutual covenants not to sue the\\nother in relation to Taltz and the patents Novartis purchased from Genentech. This matter is closed.\\nZyprexa Canada Patent Litigation\\nBeginning in the mid-2000s, several generic companies in Canada challenged the validity of our Zyprexa compound patent. In 2012, the Canadian\\nFederal Court of Appeals denied our appeal of a lower court\\'s decision that certain patent claims were invalid for lack of utility. In 2013, Apotex Inc. and\\nApotex Pharmachem Inc. (collectively, Apotex) brought claims against us in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice at Toronto for damages related to our\\nenforcement of the Zyprexa compound patent under Canadian regulations governing patented drugs. Apotex seeks compensation based on novel legal\\ntheories under the Statute of Monopolies, Trademark Act, and common law. In March 2021, the Ontario Superior Court granted our motion for summary\\njudgment, thereby dismissing Apotex\\'s case. Apotex appealed that ruling to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in April 2021. In August 2022, the Court\\ndismissed the appeal and in October 2022, Apotex appealed the decision. This matter is ongoing.\\nProduct Liability Litigation\\nByetta® Product Liability\\nWe have been named as a defendant in over 500 Byetta product liability lawsuits in the U.S. that were first initiated in March 2009 and involved over 800\\nplaintiffs. These lawsuits have been filed in various state and federal jurisdictions, including California state court (coordinated in Los Angeles County\\nSuperior Court), and various federal courts, the majority of which are coordinated in a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the U.S. District Court for the\\nSouthern District of California. The majority of these suits contained allegations that Byetta caused or contributed to the plaintiffs\\' cancer (primarily\\npancreatic cancer or thyroid cancer). All of the MDL and state court lawsuits have been dismissed as of January 2023 and we consider these matters\\nclosed.\\nEnvironmental Proceedings\\nUnder the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as \"Superfund,\" we have been designated as\\none of several potentially responsible parties with respect to the cleanup of fewer than 10 sites. Under Superfund, each responsible party may be jointly\\nand severally liable for the entire amount of the cleanup.\\n100\\n', \"Other Matters\\n340B Litigation and Investigations\\nWe are the plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in January 2021 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana against the U.S. Department of Health\\nand Human Services (HHS), the Secretary of HHS, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and the Administrator of HRSA. The\\nlawsuit challenges HHS's December 30, 2020 advisory opinion stating that drug manufacturers are required to deliver discounts under the 340B program\\nto all contract pharmacies and HHS's Administrative Dispute Resolution regulations. We seek a declaratory judgment that the defendants violated the\\nAdministrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution, a preliminary injunction enjoining implementation of the administrative dispute resolution process\\ncreated by defendants and, with it, their application of the advisory opinion, and other related relief. In March 2021, the court entered an order\\npreliminarily enjoining the government's enforcement of the administrative dispute resolution process against us. In May 2021, HRSA notified us that it\\ndetermined that our policy was contrary to the 340B statute. In response, in May 2021, we amended our complaint to bring claims related to HRSA's\\ndetermination and filed a motion for preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order requesting that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District\\nof Indiana enjoin defendants from taking any action against us relating to the 340B drug pricing program until after the court issues a final judgment on\\nthe aforementioned litigation. In May 2021, the court denied our motion for a temporary restraining order but deferred resolution of our motion for\\npreliminary injunction. In June 2021, the defendants withdrew the HHS December 30, 2020 advisory opinion. In July 2021, the court held oral argument\\non the parties' cross motions for summary judgment, the defendants' motion to dismiss, and our motion for preliminary injunction related to HRSA's May\\n2021 enforcement letter. In October 2021, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss, and granted in part and denied in part the parties' cross\\nmotions for summary judgment. Both parties filed notices of appeal related to the court's summary judgment order. In October 2022, the U.S. Court of\\nAppeals for the Seventh Circuit held oral argument. This matter is ongoing.\\nIn January 2021, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers, were named as a defendant in a petition currently pending before the HHS\\nAdministrative Dispute Resolution Panel. Petitioner seeks declaratory and other injunctive relief related to the 340B program. As described above, the\\nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana has entered a preliminary injunction enjoining the government's enforcement of this administrative\\ndispute resolution process against us.\\nIn July 2021, we, along with Sanofi-Aventis U.S., LLC (Sanofi), Novo Nordisk Inc. (Novo Nordisk), and AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP, were named as\\na defendant in a purported class action lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York by Mosaic Health, Inc. alleging antitrust\\nand unjust enrichment claims related to the defendants' 340B distribution programs. We, with Sanofi and Novo Nordisk, filed a motion to dismiss the\\nlawsuit, which was granted in September 2022. In October 2022, the plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend their complaint. This matter is ongoing.\\nWe received a civil investigative subpoena in February 2021 from the Office of the Attorney General for the State of Vermont relating to the sale of\\npharmaceutical products to Vermont covered entities under the 340B program. We are cooperating with this subpoena.\\nBranchburg Manufacturing Facility\\nIn May 2021, we received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting the production of certain documents relating to our manufacturing\\nsite in Branchburg, New Jersey. We are cooperating with the subpoena.\\n101\\n\", \"Brazil Litigation – Cosmopolis Facility\\nLabor Attorney Litigation\\nFirst initiated in 2008, our subsidiary in Brazil, Eli Lilly do Brasil Limitada (Lilly Brasil), is named in a Public Civil Action brought by the Labor Public\\nAttorney (LPA) for the 15th Region in the Labor Court of Paulinia, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, (the Labor Court) alleging possible harm to employees and\\nformer employees caused by alleged exposure to soil and groundwater contaminants at a former Lilly Brasil manufacturing facility in Cosmopolis, Brazil,\\noperated by the company between 1977 and 2003. In May 2014, the Labor Court judge ruled against Lilly Brasil, ordering it to undertake several remedial\\nand compensatory actions including health coverage for a class of individuals and certain of their children. In July 2018, the appeals court (TRT)\\ngenerally affirmed our appeal of the Labor Court's ruling, which included a liquidated award of 300 million Brazilian reais, which, when adjusted for\\ninflation and the addition of pre and post judgment interest using the current Central Bank of Brazil's special system of clearance and custody rate, is\\napproximately one billion Brazilian reais (approximately $184 million as of December 31, 2022). In August 2019, Lilly Brasil filed an appeal to the superior\\nlabor court (TST) and in June 2021, the TRT published its decision on the admissibility of Lilly Brasil's appeal, allowing the majority of the elements,\\nwhich were allowed to proceed in June 2021; elements not proceeding are subject to an interlocutory appeal to the TST that was filed in June 2021. In\\nSeptember 2019, the TRT stayed a number of elements of its trial court decision pending the determination of Lilly Brasil's appeal to the TST.\\nIn June 2019 and September 2020, the LPA filed applications in the Labor Court for enforcement of certain remedies granted by the TRT in its July 2018\\ndecision, requested restrictions on Lilly Brasil’s assets in Brazil, and required Lilly Brasil and Antibióticos do Brasil Ltda. (ABL) to submit a list of potential\\nbeneficiaries of the Public Civil Action. In July 2019, the Labor Court issued a ruling requiring a freeze of Lilly Brasil’s immovable property or, alternatively,\\na security deposit or lien of 500 million Brazilian reais, which ruling was subsequently limited in scope and the security was reduced to 100 million\\nBrazilian reais. ABL and LPA appealed the June 2021 Labor Court ruling to the TST, which appeal is under review. The Labor Court is currently\\nassessing the status of Lilly Brasil’s and ABL’s compliance with such portion of the July 2018 TRT decision and an inspection in the industrial plant is\\nexpected. These matters are ongoing.\\nIndividual Former Employee Litigation\\nLilly Brasil is also named in various pending lawsuits filed in the Labor Court by individual former employees making related claims. These individual\\nlawsuits are at various stages in the litigation process.\\nPuerto Rico Tax Matter\\nIn May 2013, the Municipality of Carolina in Puerto Rico (Municipality) filed a lawsuit against us alleging noncompliance with respect to a contract with the\\nMunicipality and seeking a declaratory judgment. In December 2020, the Puerto Rico Appellate Court (AP) reversed the summary judgment previously\\ngranted by the Court of First Instance (CFI) in our favor, dismissing the Municipality's complaint in its entirety. The AP remanded the case to the CFI for\\ntrial on the merits. The trial began in May 2022; however, the Municipality filed a new motion requesting the CFI to award damages. The request was\\ndenied by the CFI in our favor and the Municipality filed for revision at the AP, which we opposed, staying the case. In February 2023, the AP denied the\\nMunicipality's motion for revision. This matter is ongoing.\\nAverage Manufacturer Price Litigation\\nIn November 2014, we, along with another pharmaceutical manufacturer, were named as co-defendants in United States et al. ex rel. Streck v. Takeda\\nPharm. Am., Inc., et al., which was filed in November 2014 and unsealed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The complaint\\nalleges that the defendants should have treated certain credits from distributors as retroactive price increases and included such increases in calculating\\naverage manufacturer prices. Following a trial in August 2022, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The case is proceeding with post-trial\\nmotions after which the court will enter final judgment in the case. This matter is ongoing.\\n102\\n\", \"Health Choice Alliance\\nWe are named as a defendant in two lawsuits filed in Texas and New Jersey state courts in October 2019 seeking damages under the Texas Medicaid\\nFraud Prevention Act and New Jersey Medicaid False Claims Act, respectively, for certain patient support programs related to our products Humalog,\\nHumulin, and Forteo. The Texas state court action has been stayed. The New Jersey state court action was dismissed with prejudice pending an ongoing\\nappeal before the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. This matter is ongoing.\\nPricing Litigation\\nWe, along with Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, and in some matters certain pharmacy benefit managers, have been named in lawsuits related to insulin pricing\\nthat assert various theories, including consumer protection, fraud, false advertising, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, federal and state RICO statutes,\\ndeceptive trade practices, and unfair competition claims. These lawsuits include In re. Insulin Pricing Litigation, a putative consumer class action (U.S.\\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey, 2017); MSP Recovery Claims, Series, LLC et al. v. Sanofi Aventis U.S. LLC et al.  (U.S. District Court for the\\nDistrict of New Jersey, 2018); FWK Holdings, LLC v. Novo Nordisk Inc., et al. , a putative class action brought by direct purchasers of insulin (U.S. District\\nCourt for the District of New Jersey, 2020), and suits brought by the State of Minnesota (U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, 2018), State of\\nKentucky (Franklin County Circuit Court, 2019), State of Mississippi (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, 2021), State of Arkansas\\n(U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, 2022), County of Albany, New York (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York,\\n2022), State of Montana (U.S. District Court for the District of Montana, 2022), State of Kansas (U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, 2022), State\\nof Illinois (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, 2022), State of California (Los Angeles County Superior Court, 2023), Jackson County,\\nMissouri in a putative class action on behalf of Missouri counties and municipalities (Jackson County Circuit Court, 2023), and the Government of Puerto\\nRico (Court of First Instance Superior Court, San Juan, 2023). These lawsuits are at various stages in the litigation process.\\nInvestigations, Subpoenas, and Inquiries\\nIn connection with the pricing and sale of our insulin and other products, we have been subject to various investigations and received subpoenas, civil\\ninvestigative demand requests, information requests, interrogatories, and other inquiries from various governmental entities. These include subpoenas\\nfrom the New York and Vermont Attorney General Offices, civil investigative demands from the Washington, New Mexico, Colorado, Louisiana, Texas\\nand Ohio Attorney General Offices, the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, as well as information requests from the\\nMississippi, Washington D.C., California, Florida, Hawaii, and Nevada Attorney General Offices. In January 2022, the Michigan Attorney General filed a\\npetition in Michigan state court seeking authorization to investigate Lilly for potential violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act (MCPA), and a\\ncomplaint seeking a declaratory judgment that the Attorney General has authority to investigate Lilly's sale of insulin under the MCPA. The court\\nauthorized the proposed investigation and the issuance of civil investigative subpoenas. In April 2022, the parties entered into a stipulation providing that\\nthe State of Michigan will not issue any civil investigative subpoena to us under the MCPA until the declaratory judgment action is resolved. In July 2022,\\nthe court dismissed the case in its entirety. The Michigan Attorney General filed a notice of appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which remains\\npending.\\nWe received a request in January 2019 from the House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Reform seeking commercial information and\\nbusiness records related to the pricing of insulin products, among other issues. We also received similar requests from the Senate Finance Committee\\nand the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and separate requests from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce\\nmajority and minority members. In January 2021, the Senate Finance Committee released a report summarizing the findings of its investigation. In\\nDecember 2021 the House of Representatives' Committee on Oversight and Reform majority and minority staffs released separate reports with findings\\nfrom their investigations into drug pricing, including of insulin products.\\nWe are cooperating with all of the aforementioned investigations, subpoenas, and inquiries.\\n103\\n\", \"Research Corporation Technologies, Inc.\\nIn April 2016, we were named as a defendant in litigation filed by Research Corporation Technologies, Inc. (RCT) in the U.S. District Court for the District\\nof Arizona. RCT is seeking damages for breach of contract, unjust enrichment, and conversion related to processes used to manufacture certain products,\\nincluding Humalog and Humulin. In October 2021, the court issued a summary judgment decision finding in favor of RCT on certain issues, including with\\nrespect to a disputed royalty. Both parties filed motions for reconsideration, which were denied. We filed supplemental summary judgment motions.

We have global financial policies that govern critical areas,\\nincluding internal controls, financial accounting and reporting, fiduciary accountability, and safeguarding of corporate assets.

A staff of internal auditors regularly monitors, on a worldwide basis, the adequacy and effectiveness of internal accounting controls.\\nThe general auditor reports directly to the audit committee of the board of directors.\\nWe conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control—Integrated\\nFramework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\\n106\\n', 'Based on our evaluation under this framework, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\\nHowever, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

In our opinion, the\\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the\\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\\'s\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an\\nunqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s financial\\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\\nthe PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included\\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\\noverall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\n108\\n', 'Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate accruals\\nDescription of the Matter\\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Net Product Revenue,\" the Company\\nestablishes provisions for sales rebate and discounts in the same period as the related sales occur. At December 31,\\n2022 the Company had $8,784.1 million in sales rebate and discount accruals. A large portion of these accruals are\\nrebates associated with sales in the United States for which payment for purchase of the product is covered by\\nMedicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare.\\nAuditing the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare sales rebate and discount liabilities is challenging because of the\\nsubjectivity of certain assumptions required to estimate the rebate liabilities. In calculating the appropriate accrual\\namount, the Company considers historical Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate payments by product as a\\npercentage of their historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends, the lag in payment timing, an\\nevaluation of the current Medicaid and Medicare laws and interpretations, the percentage of products that are sold via\\nMedicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare, and product pricing. For Medicaid, there is significant complexity associated\\nwith calculating the legislated Medicaid rebates. Management utilizes employees with legislative experience and\\nknowledge in developing assumptions used to calculate Medicaid rebates. Similarly, for Managed Care and Medicare,\\ngiven variability in prescription drug costs, continued historical year over year increases in enrollees and variability in\\nprescription data, historical rebate information may not be predictive for management to estimate the rebate accrual and\\nthus, management supplements its historical data analysis with qualitative adjustments based upon current utilization.\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our Audit\\nWe tested the Company\\'s controls addressing the identified risks of material misstatement related to the valuation of the\\nsales rebate and discount liabilities. This included testing controls over management\\'s review of the significant\\nassumptions used to calculate the Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare rebate liabilities, including the significant\\nassumptions discussed above. This testing also included management\\'s control to compare actual activity to forecasted\\nactivity and controls to ensure the data used to evaluate the significant assumptions was complete and accurate.\\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating for reasonableness the significant assumptions in light of\\neconomic trends, product profiles, and other regulatory factors. Our testing involved assessing the historical accuracy of\\nmanagement\\'s estimates by comparing actual activity to previous estimates and performing analytical procedures, based\\non internal and external data sources, to evaluate the completeness of the reserves. Additionally, our procedures\\nincluded reviewing a sample of contracts, testing a sample of rebate payments and testing the underlying data used in\\nmanagement\\'s evaluation. For Medicaid, we involved our professionals with an understanding of the statutory\\nreimbursement requirements to assess the consistency of the Company\\'s calculation methodologies with the applicable\\ngovernment regulations and policy. For Medicare we evaluated the reasonableness of assumptions made by\\nmanagement in estimating the Medicare coverage gap liability.\\n109\\n', 'Retirement Benefits - Valuation of Alternative Investments\\nDescription of the Matter\\nAs described in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements under the caption \"Benefit Plan Investments,\" the\\nCompany\\'s benefit plan investment policies are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirements in\\nrelationship to the respective liabilities. At December 31, 2022 the Company had $15,688.3 million in plan assets related\\nto the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health benefit plans. Approximately 50 percent of the total pension and\\nretiree health assets are in hedge funds and private equity-like investment funds (\"alternative investments\"). These\\nalternative investments are valued using significant unobservable inputs or are valued at net asset value (NAV) reported\\nby the counterparty, adjusted as necessary.\\nAuditing the fair value of these alternative investments is challenging because of the higher estimation uncertainty of the\\ninputs to the fair value calculations, including the underlying net asset values (\"NAVs\"), discounted cash flow valuations,\\ncomparable market valuations, and adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity and other risks. Additionally, certain\\ninformation regarding the fair value of these alternative investments is based on unaudited information available to\\nmanagement at the time of valuation.\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our Audit\\nWe tested the Company\\'s controls addressing the risks of material misstatement relating to valuation of alternative\\ninvestments. This included testing management\\'s review controls over alternative investment valuation, which included a\\ncomparison of returns to benchmarks and monitoring of investment firms\\' valuation policies and procedures, as well as\\nportfolio performance.\\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing fund returns to selected relevant benchmarks and\\nunderstanding variations, obtaining the latest audited financial statements and comparing to the Company\\'s estimated\\nfair values. We also inquired of management about changes to the investment portfolio and/or related investment\\nstrategies and considerations. We assessed the historical accuracy of management\\'s estimates by comparing actual\\nactivity to previous estimates. We evaluated for contrary evidence by confirming the fair value of the investments and\\nownership interest directly with the trustees and a sample of managers at year end.\\n/s/    Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company\\'s auditor since 1940.\\nIndianapolis, Indiana\\nFebruary 22, 2023\\n110\\n', \"Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Eli Lilly and Company\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited Eli Lilly and Company and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established\\nin Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the\\nCOSO criteria).

       "  Document(page_content='Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses\\nGross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.8 percent in 2022, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with 2021, primarily driven by a net\\ninventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies recognized in 2021 and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international\\ninventories sold in 2021. Additionally, in 2022, favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the\\ntreatment of COVID-19, were offset by lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs.\\nResearch and development expenses increased 4 percent to $7.19 billion in 2022, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage\\nassets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\\nMarketing, selling, and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $6.44 billion in 2022, as increased costs associated with launches of new\\nproducts and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\\nWe have undertaken compensatory actions to improve retention and address wage inflation, which will increase compensation costs and impact our\\nconsolidated results of operations.\\nWe recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $908.5 million in 2022 that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that\\nwere contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review\\nVoucher. We recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $970.1 million in 2021 that included charges resulting from business\\ndevelopment transactions with Foghorn, Rigel, and Precision. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\\nWe recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $244.6 million in 2022, primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for\\nGBA1 Gene Therapy (PR001) due to changes in estimated launch timing. We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of\\n$316.1 million in 2021, primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo, an intangible asset impairment\\nresulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza, as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail.\\nOther—net, (income) expense was expense of $320.9 million in 2022, primarily driven by net investment losses on equity securities. Other—net, (income)\\nexpense was expense of $201.6 million in 2021, primarily driven by a debt extinguishment loss of $405.2 million related to the repurchase of debt,\\npartially offset by net investment gains on equity securities.\\nOur effective tax rate was 8.3 percent in 2022, reflecting the favorable tax impact of the implementation of a provision in the 2017 Tax Act that requires\\ncapitalization and amortization of research and development expenses for tax purposes starting in 2022, partially offset by the tax impact of the mix of\\nearnings in higher tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate was 9.3 percent in 2021, reflecting the favorable tax impacts of acquired IPR&D and\\ndevelopment milestone charges, net investment gains on equity securities, and a net discrete tax benefit.\\nOperating Results—2021\\nFor a discussion of our results of operations pertaining to 2021 and 2020 see Item 7, \"Management\\'s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations\\nand Financial Condition\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.\\n48\\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/10K examples/LLY_10K.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/10K examples/LLY_10K.pdf', 'page': 47, 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'lly-20221231', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6', 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'creationDate': \"D:20240118054548-05'00'\", 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''}),\n",

In the U.S. the decrease in realized prices was primarily driven by\\nHumalog, due to a list price reduction of insulin lispro injection and unfavorable segment mix, and Trulicity and Basaglar , due to unfavorable segment mix\\nand higher contracted rebates.

In connection with these arrangements, our partners may be entitled to future royalties and/or commercial milestones based on\\nsales should products be approved for commercialization and/or milestones based on the successful progress of compounds through the development\\nprocess.\\nIn December 2022, January 2021, and February 2020, we completed the acquisitions of Akouos, Inc. (Akouos), Prevail Therapeutics Inc. (Prevail), and\\nDermira, Inc. (Dermira), respectively. These transactions, as further discussed below in Acquisitions of Businesses, were accounted for as business\\ncombinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their\\nrespective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The determination of estimated fair value required management\\nto make significant estimates and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, has\\nbeen recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of\\nacquisition.\\nWe also acquired assets in development in 2022, 2021, and 2020, which are further discussed below in Asset Acquisitions. Upon each acquisition, the\\ncost allocated to acquired IPR&D was immediately expensed if the compound has no alternative future use. Milestone payment obligations incurred prior\\nto regulatory approval of the compound are expensed when the event triggering an obligation to pay the milestone occurs. We recognized acquired\\nIPR&D and development milestone charges of $908.5 million, $970.1 million, and $769.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and\\n2020, respectively.\\nAcquisitions of Businesses\\nAkouos Acquisition\\nOverview of Transaction\\nIn December 2022, we acquired all shares of Akouos for a purchase price that included $ 12.50 per share in cash (or an aggregate of $327.2 million, net\\nof cash acquired) plus one non-tradable contingent value right (CVR) per share. The CVR entitles the Akouos shareholders up to an additional $ 3.00 per\\nshare in cash (or an aggregate of approximately $122 million) payable, subject to certain terms and conditions, upon the achievement of certain specified\\nmilestones.\\nUnder the terms of the agreement, we acquired potential gene therapy treatments for hearing loss and other inner ear conditions. The lead gene\\ntherapies in clinical development that we acquired included GJB2 (which encodes connexin 26) for a common form of monogenic deafness and hearing\\nloss; AK-OTOF for hearing loss due to mutations in the otoferlin gene; AK-CLRN1 for Usher Type 3A, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by\\nprogressive loss of both hearing and vision; and AK-antiVEGF for vestibular schwannoma.\\n(1)\\n(1) \\n67\\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/10K examples/LLY_10K.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/10K examples/LLY_10K.pdf', 'page': 66, 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'lly-20221231', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6', 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'creationDate': \"D:20240118054548-05'00'\", 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''})],\n",
