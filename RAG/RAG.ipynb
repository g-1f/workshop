Additionally, in 2022, favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the\\ntreatment of COVID-19, were offset by lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs.\\nResearch and development expenses increased 4 percent to $7.19 billion in 2022, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage\\nassets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\\nMarketing, selling, and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $6.44 billion in 2022, as increased costs associated with launches of new\\nproducts and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\\nWe have undertaken compensatory actions to improve retention and address wage inflation, which will increase compensation costs and impact our\\nconsolidated results of operations.\\nWe recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $908.5 million in 2022 that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that\\nwere contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review\\nVoucher.

See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\\nWe recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $244.6 million in 2022, primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for\\nGBA1 Gene Therapy (PR001) due to changes in estimated launch timing. We recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of\\n$316.1 million in 2021, primarily related to an impairment of a contract-based intangible asset from our acquisition of Loxo, an intangible asset impairment\\nresulting from the sale of the rights to Qbrexza, as well as acquisition and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Prevail.\\nOther—net, (income) expense was expense of $320.9 million in 2022, primarily driven by net investment losses on equity securities.

       "  Document(page_content='Gross Margin, Costs, and Expenses\\nGross margin as a percent of revenue was 76.8 percent in 2022, an increase of 2.6 percentage points compared with 2021, primarily driven by a net\\ninventory impairment charge related to our COVID-19 antibodies recognized in 2021 and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates on international\\ninventories sold in 2021. Additionally, in 2022, favorable product mix, including the impact of lower sales of COVID-19 antibodies and Olumiant for the\\ntreatment of COVID-19, were offset by lower realized prices and increased expenses due to inflation and logistics costs.\\nResearch and development expenses increased 4 percent to $7.19 billion in 2022, driven primarily by higher development expenses for late-stage\\nassets, partially offset by lower development expenses for COVID-19 antibodies and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\\nMarketing, selling, and administrative expenses remained relatively flat at $6.44 billion in 2022, as increased costs associated with launches of new\\nproducts and indications were offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates.\\nWe have undertaken compensatory actions to improve retention and address wage inflation, which will increase compensation costs and impact our\\nconsolidated results of operations.\\nWe recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $908.5 million in 2022 that included the buy-out of substantially all future obligations that\\nwere contingent upon the occurrence of certain events linked to the success of our mutant-selective PI3kα inhibitor and a purchase of a Priority Review\\nVoucher. We recognized acquired IPR&D and development milestones of $970.1 million in 2021 that included charges resulting from business\\ndevelopment transactions with Foghorn, Rigel, and Precision. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\\nWe recognized asset impairment, restructuring, and other special charges of $244.6 million in 2022, primarily related to an intangible asset impairment for\\nGBA1 Gene Therapy (PR001) due to changes in estimated launch timing.

The average combined cost per unit of Model 3 and Model Y increased year over year due to rising \\nraw material, logistics and warranty costs. There were also idle capacity charges of $306 million primarily related to the temporary suspension of production at \\nGigafactory Shanghai as well as the ramping up of production in Gigafactory Texas and our proprietary battery cells manufacturing during the year ended December 31, \\n2022. We had also incurred costs related to the ramp up of production in Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg during the year ended December 31, 2022. These increases \\nwere partially offset by a decrease in combined average Model S and Model X costs per unit driven by lower average cost for the new versions from ramping up \\nproduction. Further, these increases in costs of revenue were positively impacted by the United States dollar strengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 \\ncompared to the prior period.\\nCost of automotive leasing revenue increased $531 million, or 54%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, \\nprimarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing cost of revenues from more \\nactivities in the current year.\\nCost of services and other revenue increased $1.97 billion, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The \\nchange is primarily due to an increase in used vehicle cost of revenue driven by increases in volume and costs of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicle sales, an increase in \\nnon-warranty maintenance service revenue, and an increase in costs of paid Supercharging, insurance services and retail merchandise.\\nGross margin for total automotive decreased from 29.3% to 28.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. This \\nwas driven by the changes in automotive sales revenue and cost of automotive sales revenue, partially offset by an increase in regulatory credits revenue, as discussed \\nearlier.\\nGross margin for total automotive & services and other segment decreased from 26.9% to 26.5% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year \\nended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the automotive gross margin decrease discussed above, partially offset by an improvement in our services and other gross \\nmargin. Additionally, services and other was a higher percentage of the segment gross margin during the year ended 2022 as compared to the prior year.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead \\ncosts and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of our \\ninventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. In agreements for solar \\nenergy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs \\nassociated with those systems and amortization of any initial direct costs.\\n2022 compared to 2021\\nCost of energy generation and storage revenue increased $703 million, or 24%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December \\n31, 2021, primarily due to increases in energy storage deployments of Megapack and Powerwall, as well as higher average cost of solar cash and loan deployments due \\nto increased component costs.\\nGross margin for energy generation and storage increased from -4.6% to 7.4% in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December \\n31, 2021. This was driven by the growth in energy generation and storage revenue and cost of energy generation and storage revenue as discussed above. Additionally, \\nthere was a higher proportion of energy storage sales, which operated at a higher gross margin, within the segment.\\n39\\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/TSLA_10K.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/TSLA_10K.pdf', 'page': 38, 'total_pages': 108, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '10-K', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6', 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'creationDate': \"D:20240118054459-05'00'\", 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''}),\n",

These deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to \\nlease accounting. \\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly \\nrelated to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing \\narrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits. \\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue \\nincludes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services and parts, paid Supercharging, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise and \\nvehicle insurance revenue.\\n2022 compared to 2021\\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $23.09 billion, or 52%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily \\ndue to an increase of 347,024 Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, and an increase of 38,183 Model S and Model X deliveries year over year. This was achieved from \\nproduction ramping of Model Y at Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory as well as the start of production at Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg and Gigafactory \\nTexas in 2022, at a higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales despite a negative impact from the United States dollar \\nstrengthening against other foreign currencies in 2022 compared to the prior period. There was also an increase in production of Model S and Model X and an increase \\nin the combined average selling price of Model S and Model X with a higher proportion of Model X sales, compared to the prior period as deliveries of the new versions \\nof Model S and Model X began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we recognized $324 million \\nin revenue related to the general FSD feature release in North America. \\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue increased $311 million, or 21%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, \\nprimarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional consideration of $288 million in revenue in the first quarter of 2022 for credits sold previously, in \\nthe absence of which we had only an immaterial increase in automotive regulatory credits revenue.\\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $834 million, or 51%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The \\nchange is primarily due to an increase in activities under our direct operating lease program as well as an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue.\\nServices and other revenue increased $2.29 billion, or 60%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The change \\nis primarily due to increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used Tesla and non-Tesla vehicles, non-warranty \\nmaintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow, paid Supercharging revenue, insurance services revenue and retail merchandise revenue.\\n37\\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/TSLA_10K.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/TSLA_10K.pdf', 'page': 36, 'total_pages': 108, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '10-K', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6', 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'creationDate': \"D:20240118054459-05'00'\", 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''}),\n",

Actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our \\nvehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of our reserve of $365 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented increases in automotive sales revenue. \\nThe net release or increase of reserves which impacted automotive sales revenue were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2020. \\nFurther, $324 million of the total revenue recognized as of December 31, 2022 is related to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of \\n2022.\\n \\nAutomotive Segment\\nAutomotive Sales\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the \\ndefinition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air software \\nupdates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at \\nthe point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the contractual \\nloan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when we offer resale value \\nguarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and \\nover-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to \\ndeliver such services to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize \\nrevenue related to these other features and services over the performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD is \\nrecognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related to automotive \\nsales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other information that \\nmay be available.\\nAny fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. Costs \\nto obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive sales are typically \\nfulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as \\nautomotive sales revenue, and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the \\ncustomer as an expense in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\\n54\\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/TSLA_10K.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/TSLA_10K.pdf', 'page': 53, 'total_pages': 108, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': '10-K', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6', 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'creationDate': \"D:20240118054459-05'00'\", 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''}),\n",

In our opinion, the\\nconsolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the\\nresults of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted\\naccounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\\'s\\ninternal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the\\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 22, 2023 expressed an\\nunqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\\'s financial\\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the\\nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and\\nthe PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\\nreasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included\\nperforming procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial\\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\\noverall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or\\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2)\\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion\\non the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\n108\\n', metadata={'source': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/LLY_10K.pdf', 'file_path': '/Users/gyf/Desktop/workshop/pdfs/LLY_10K.pdf', 'page': 107, 'total_pages': 120, 'format': 'PDF 1.4', 'title': 'lly-20221231', 'author': '', 'subject': '', 'keywords': '', 'creator': 'wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6', 'producer': 'Qt 4.8.7', 'creationDate': \"D:20240118054548-05'00'\", 'modDate': '', 'trapped': ''})],\n",

Intelligent Cloud revenue increased driven by Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue \\nincreased driven by Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. More Personal Computing revenue decreased driven by Windows  and Devices. \\nCost of revenue increased $3.2 billion or 5% driven by growth in Microsoft Cloud, offset in part by the change in accounting estimate.\\nGross margin increased $10.4 billion or 8% driven by growth in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes and the change in accounting \\nestimate, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing. \\n•Gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased 1 \\npoint driven by declines in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing, offset in part by sales mix shift between our segments.\\n•Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased 2 points to 72%.
